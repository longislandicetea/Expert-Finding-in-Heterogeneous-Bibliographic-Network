#! Sampling is a popular method of data collection when it is impossible or too costly to reach the entire population. For example, television show ratings in the United States are gathered from a sample of roughly 5,000 households. To use the results effectively, the samples are further partitioned in a multidimensional space based on multiple attribute values. This naturally leads to the desirability of OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) over sampling data. However, unlike traditional data, sampling data is inherently uncertain, i.e., not representing the full data in the population. Thus, it is desirable to return not only query results but also the confidence intervals indicating the reliability of the results. Moreover, a certain segment in a multidimensional space may contain none or too few samples. This requires some additional analysis to return trustable results. In this paper we propose a Sampling Cube framework, which efficiently calculates confidence intervals for any multidimensional query and uses the OLAP structure to group similar segments to increase sampling size when needed. Further, to handle high dimensional data, a Sampling Cube Shell method is proposed to effectively reduce the storage requirement while still preserving query result quality.

#! Online bibliographic databases, such as DBLP in computer science and PubMed in medical sciences, contain abundant information about research publications in different fields. Each such database forms a gigantic information network (hence called BibNet), connecting in complex ways research papers, authors, conferences/journals, and possibly citation information as well, and provides a fertile land for information network analysis. Our BibNetMiner is designed for sophisticated information network mining on such bibliographic databases. In this demo, we will take the DBLP database as an example, demonstrate several attractive functions of BibNetMiner, including clustering, ranking and profiling of conferences and authors based on the research subfields. A user-friendly, visualization-enhanced interface will be provided to facilitate interactive exploration of a bibliographic database. This project will serve as an example to demonstrate the power of links in information network mining. Since the dataset is large and the network is heterogeneous, such a study will benefit the research on the analysis of massive heterogeneous information networks.

#! Nowadays, enormous amounts of data are continuously generated not only in massive scale, but also from different, sometimes conflicting, views. Therefore, it is important to consolidate different concepts for intelligent decision making. For example, to predict the research areas of some people, the best results are usually achieved by combining and consolidating predictions obtained from the publication network, co-authorship network and the textual content of their publications. Multiple supervised and unsupervised hypotheses can be drawn from these information sources, and negotiating their differences and consolidating decisions usually yields a much more accurate model due to the diversity and heterogeneity of these models. In this paper, we address the problem of "consensus learning" among competing hypotheses, which either rely on outside knowledge (supervised learning) or internal structure (unsupervised clustering). We argue that consensus learning is an NP-hard problem and thus propose to solve it by an efficient heuristic method. We construct a belief graph to first propagate predictions from supervised models to the unsupervised, and then negotiate and reach consensus among them. Their final decision is further consolidated by calculating each model's weight based on its degree of consistency with other models. Experiments are conducted on 20 Newsgroups data, Cora research papers, DBLP author-conference network, and Yahoo! Movies datasets, and the results show that the proposed method improves the classification accuracy and the clustering quality measure (NMI) over the best base model by up to 10%. Furthermore, it runs in time proportional to the number of instances, which is very efficient for large scale data sets.

#! A heterogeneous information network is an information network composed of multiple types of objects. Clustering on such a network may lead to better understanding of both hidden structures of the network and the individual role played by every object in each cluster. However, although clustering on homogeneous networks has been studied over decades, clustering on heterogeneous networks has not been addressed until recently. A recent study proposed a new algorithm, RankClus, for clustering on bi-typed heterogeneous networks. However, a real-world network may consist of more than two types, and the interactions among multi-typed objects play a key role at disclosing the rich semantics that a network carries. In this paper, we study clustering of multi-typed heterogeneous networks with a star network schema and propose a novel algorithm, NetClus, that utilizes links across multityped objects to generate high-quality net-clusters. An iterative enhancement method is developed that leads to effective ranking-based clustering in such heterogeneous networks. Our experiments on DBLP data show that NetClus generates more accurate clustering results than the baseline topic model algorithm PLSA and the recently proposed algorithm, RankClus. Further, NetClus generates informative clusters, presenting good ranking and cluster membership information for each attribute object in each net-cluster.

#! Document networks, i.e., networks associated with text information, are becoming increasingly popular due to the ubiquity of Web documents, blogs, and various kinds of online data. In this paper, we propose a novel topic modeling framework for document networks, which builds a unified generative topic model that is able to consider both text and structure information for documents. A graphical model is proposed to describe the generative model. On the top layer of this graphical model, we define a novel multivariate Markov Random Field for topic distribution random variables for each document, to model the dependency relationships among documents over the network structure. On the bottom layer, we follow the traditional topic model to model the generation of text for each document. A joint distribution function for both the text and structure of the documents is thus provided. A solution to estimate this topic model is given, by maximizing the log-likelihood of the joint probability. Some important practical issues in real applications are also discussed, including how to decide the topic number and how to choose a good network structure. We apply the model on two real datasets, DBLP and Cora, and the experiments show that this model is more effective in comparison with the state-of-the-art topic modeling algorithms.

#! Nowadays, most business, administration, and/or scientific databases contain both structured attributes and text attributes. We call a database that consists of both multidimensional structured data and narrative text data as multidimensional text database. Searching, OLAP, and mining such databases pose many research challenges. To enhance the power of data analysis, interesting entities and relationships can be extracted from such databases to derive heterogeneous information networks, which in turn will substantially increase the power and flexibility of data exploration in such databases. Based on our previous studies on TextCube [1], TopicCube [2], and information network analysis, such as RankClus [3] and NetClus [4], we construct iNextCube, an information-Network-enhanced text Cube. In this demo, we show the power of iNextCube in the search and analysis of two multidimensional text databases: (i) a DBLP-based CS bibliographic database, and (ii) an online news database.

#! Most people consider a database is merely a data repository that supports data storage and retrieval. Actually, a database contains rich, inter-related, multi-typed data and information, forming one or a set of gigantic, interconnected, heterogeneous information networks. Much knowledge can be derived from such information networks if we systematically develop an effective and scalable database-oriented information network analysis technology. In this tutorial, we introduce database-oriented information network analysis methods and demonstrate how information networks can be used to improve data quality and consistency, facilitate data integration, and generate interesting knowledge. This tutorial presents an organized picture on how to turn a database into one or a set of organized heterogeneous information networks, how information networks can be used for data cleaning, data consolidation, and data qualify improvement, how to discover various kinds of knowledge from information networks, how to perform OLAP in information networks, and how to transform database data into knowledge by information network analysis. Moreover, we present interesting case studies on real datasets, including DBLP and Flickr, and show how interesting and organized knowledge can be generated from database-oriented information networks.

#! Linked or networked data are ubiquitous in many applications. Examples include web data or hypertext documents connected via hyperlinks, social networks or user profiles connected via friend links, co-authorship and citation information, blog data, movie reviews and so on. In these datasets (called "information networks"), closely related objects that share the same properties or interests form a community. For example, a community in blogsphere could be users mostly interested in cell phone reviews and news. Outlier detection in information networks can reveal important anomalous and interesting behaviors that are not obvious if community information is ignored. An example could be a low-income person being friends with many rich people even though his income is not anomalously low when considered over the entire population. This paper first introduces the concept of community outliers (interesting points or rising stars for a more positive sense), and then shows that well-known baseline approaches without considering links or community information cannot find these community outliers. We propose an efficient solution by modeling networked data as a mixture model composed of multiple normal communities and a set of randomly generated outliers. The probabilistic model characterizes both data and links simultaneously by defining their joint distribution based on hidden Markov random fields (HMRF). Maximizing the data likelihood and the posterior of the model gives the solution to the outlier inference problem. We apply the model on both synthetic data and DBLP data sets, and the results demonstrate importance of this concept, as well as the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.

#! Community detection is an important task for mining the structure and function of complex networks. Generally, there are several different kinds of nodes in a network which are cluster nodes densely connected within communities, as well as some special nodes like hubs bridging multiple communities and outliers marginally connected with a community. In addition, it has been shown that there is a hierarchical structure in complex networks with communities embedded within other communities. Therefore, a good algorithm is desirable to be able to not only detect hierarchical communities, but also identify hubs and outliers. In this paper, we propose a parameter-free hierarchical network clustering algorithm SHRINK by combining the advantages of density-based clustering and modularity optimization methods. Based on the structural connectivity information, the proposed algorithm can effectively reveal the embedded hierarchical community structure with multiresolution in large-scale weighted undirected networks, and identify hubs and outliers as well. Moreover, it overcomes the sensitive threshold problem of density-based clustering algorithms and the resolution limit possessed by other modularity-based methods. To illustrate our methodology, we conduct experiments with both real-world and synthetic datasets for community detection, and compare with many other baseline methods. Experimental results demonstrate that SHRINK achieves the best performance with consistent improvements.

#! A heterogeneous information network is a network composed of multiple types of objects and links. Recently, it has been recognized that strongly-typed heterogeneous information networks are prevalent in the real world. Sometimes, label information is available for some objects. Learning from such labeled and unlabeled data via transductive classification can lead to good knowledge extraction of the hidden network structure. However, although classification on homogeneous networks has been studied for decades, classification on heterogeneous networks has not been explored until recently. In this paper, we consider the transductive classification problem on heterogeneous networked data which share a common topic. Only some objects in the given network are labeled, and we aim to predict labels for all types of the remaining objects. A novel graph-based regularization framework, GNetMine, is proposed to model the link structure in information networks with arbitrary network schema and arbitrary number of object/link types. Specifically, we explicitly respect the type differences by preserving consistency over each relation graph corresponding to each type of links separately. Efficient computational schemes are then introduced to solve the corresponding optimization problem. Experiments on the DBLP data set show that our algorithm significantly improves the classification accuracy over existing state-of-the-art methods.

#! WINACS (Web-based Information Network Analysis for Computer Science) is a project that incorporates many recent, exciting developments in data sciences to construct a Web-based computer science information network and to discover, retrieve, rank, cluster, and analyze such an information network. With the rapid development of the Web, huge amounts of information are available in the form of Web documents, structures, and links. It has been a dream of the database and Web communities to harvest such information and reconcile the unstructured nature of the Web with the neat, semi-structured schemas of the database paradigm. Taking computer science as a dedicated domain, WINACS first discovers related Web entity structures, and then constructs a heterogeneous computer science information network in order to rank, cluster and analyze this network and support intelligent and analytical queries.

#! With the rapid development of online social media, online shopping sites and cyber-physical systems, heterogeneous information networks have become increasingly popular and content-rich over time. In many cases, such networks contain multiple types of objects and links, as well as different kinds of attributes. The clustering of these objects can provide useful insights in many applications. However, the clustering of such networks can be challenging since (a) the attribute values of objects are often incomplete, which implies that an object may carry only partial attributes or even no attributes to correctly label itself; and (b) the links of different types may carry different kinds of semantic meanings, and it is a difficult task to determine the nature of their relative importance in helping the clustering for a given purpose. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a model-based clustering algorithm. We design a probabilistic model which clusters the objects of different types into a common hidden space, by using a user-specified set of attributes, as well as the links from different relations. The strengths of different types of links are automatically learned, and are determined by the given purpose of clustering. An iterative algorithm is designed for solving the clustering problem, in which the strengths of different types of links and the quality of clustering results mutually enhance each other. Our experimental results on real and synthetic data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm.

#! Most objects and data in the real world are interconnected, forming complex, heterogeneous but often semistructured information networks. However, many database researchers consider a database merely as a data repository that supports storage and retrieval rather than an information-rich, inter-related and multi-typed information network that supports comprehensive data analysis, whereas many network researchers focus on homogeneous networks. Departing from both, we view interconnected, semi-structured datasets as heterogeneous, information-rich networks and study how to uncover hidden knowledge in such networks. For example, a university database can be viewed as a heterogeneous information network, where objects of multiple types, such as students, professors, courses, departments, and multiple typed relationships, such as teach and advise are intertwined together, providing abundant information. In this tutorial, we present an organized picture on mining heterogeneous information networks and introduce a set of interesting, effective and scalable network mining methods. The topics to be covered include (i) database as an information network, (ii) mining information networks: clustering, classification, ranking, similarity search, and meta path-guided analysis, (iii) construction of quality, informative networks by data mining, (iv) trend and evolution analysis in heterogeneous information networks, and (v) research frontiers. We show that heterogeneous information networks are informative, and link analysis on such networks is powerful at uncovering critical knowledge hidden in large semi-structured datasets. Finally, we also present a few promising research directions.

#! A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) integrates physical devices (e.g., sensors, cameras) with cyber (or informational) components to form a situation-integrated analytical system that may respond intelligently to dynamic changes of the real-world situations. CPS claims many promising applications, such as traffic observation, battlefield surveillance and sensor-network based monitoring. One important research topic in CPS is about the atypical event analysis, i.e., retrieving the events from large amount of data and analyzing them with spatial, temporal and other multi-dimensional information. Many traditional approaches are not feasible for such analysis since they use numeric measures and cannot describe the complex atypical events. In this study, we propose a new model of atypical cluster to effectively represent those events and efficiently retrieve them from massive data. The micro-cluster is designed to summarize individual events, and the macro-cluster is used to integrate the information from multiple event. To facilitate scalable, flexible and online analysis, the concept of significant cluster is defined and a guided clustering algorithm is proposed to retrieve significant clusters in an efficient manner. We conduct experiments on real datasets with the size of more than 50 GB, the results show that the proposed method can provide more accurate information with only 15% to 20% time cost of the baselines.

#! Temporal datasets, in which data evolves continuously, exist in a wide variety of applications, and identifying anomalous or outlying objects from temporal datasets is an important and challenging task. Different from traditional outlier detection, which detects objects that have quite different behavior compared with the other objects, temporal outlier detection tries to identify objects that have different evolutionary behavior compared with other objects. Usually objects form multiple communities, and most of the objects belonging to the same community follow similar patterns of evolution. However, there are some objects which evolve in a very different way relative to other community members, and we define such objects as evolutionary community outliers. This definition represents a novel type of outliers considering both temporal dimension and community patterns. We investigate the problem of identifying evolutionary community outliers given the discovered communities from two snapshots of an evolving dataset. To tackle the challenges of community evolution and outlier detection, we propose an integrated optimization framework which conducts outlier-aware community matching across snapshots and identification of evolutionary outliers in a tightly coupled way. A coordinate descent algorithm is proposed to improve community matching and outlier detection performance iteratively. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed approach is highly effective in discovering interesting evolutionary community outliers.

#! Real-world, multiple-typed objects are often interconnected, forming heterogeneous information networks. A major challenge for link-based clustering in such networks is its potential to generate many different results, carrying rather diverse semantic meanings. In order to generate desired clustering, we propose to use meta-path, a path that connects object types via a sequence of relations, to control clustering with distinct semantics. Nevertheless, it is easier for a user to provide a few examples ("seeds") than a weighted combination of sophisticated meta-paths to specify her clustering preference. Thus, we propose to integrate meta-path selection with user-guided clustering to cluster objects in networks, where a user first provides a small set of object seeds for each cluster as guidance. Then the system learns the weights for each meta-path that are consistent with the clustering result implied by the guidance, and generates clusters under the learned weights of meta-paths. A probabilistic approach is proposed to solve the problem, and an effective and efficient iterative algorithm, PathSelClus, is proposed to learn the model, where the clustering quality and the meta-path weights are mutually enhancing each other. Our experiments with several clustering tasks in two real networks demonstrate the power of the algorithm in comparison with the baselines.

#! Heterogeneous information networks that contain multiple types of objects and links are ubiquitous in the real world, such as bibliographic networks, cyber-physical networks, and social media networks. Although researchers have studied various data mining tasks in information networks, interactive query-based network exploration techniques have not been addressed systematically, which, in fact, are highly desirable for exploring large-scale information networks. In this demo, we introduce and demonstrate our recent research project on query-driven discovery of semantically similar substructures in heterogeneous networks. Given a subgraph query, our system searches a given large information network and finds efficiently a list of subgraphs that are structurally identical and semantically similar. Since data mining methods are used to obtain semantically similar entities (nodes), we use discovery as a term to describe this process. In order to achieve high efficiency and scalability, we design and implement a filter-and verification search framework, which can first generate promising subgraph candidates using off line indices built by data mining results, and then verify candidates with a recursive pruning matching process. The proposed system demonstrates the effectiveness of our query-driven semantic similarity search framework and the efficiency of the proposed methodology on multiple real-world heterogeneous information networks.

#! Most objects and data in the real world are interconnected, forming complex, heterogeneous but often semi-structured information networks. However, most people consider a database merely as a data repository that supports data storage and retrieval rather than one or a set of heterogeneous information networks that contain rich, inter-related, multi-typed data and information. Most network science researchers only study homogeneous networks, without distinguishing the different types of objects and links in the networks. In this tutorial, we view database and other interconnected data as heterogeneous information networks, and study how to leverage the rich semantic meaning of types of objects and links in the networks. We systematically introduce the technologies that can effectively and efficiently mine useful knowledge from such information networks.

#! Numerous applications, such as bank transactions, road traffic, and news feeds, generate temporal datasets, in which data evolves continuously. To understand the temporal behavior and characteristics of the dataset and its elements, we need effective tools that can capture evolution of the objects. In this paper, we propose a novel and important problem in evolution behavior discovery. Given a series of snapshots of a temporal dataset, each of which consists of evolving communities, our goal is to find objects which evolve in a dramatically different way compared with the other community members. We define such objects as community trend outliers. It is a challenging problem as evolutionary patterns are hidden deeply in noisy evolving datasets and thus it is difficult to distinguish anomalous objects from normal ones. We propose an effective two-step procedure to detect community trend outliers. We first model the normal evolutionary behavior of communities across time using soft patterns discovered from the dataset. In the second step, we propose effective measures to evaluate chances of an object deviating from the normal evolutionary patterns. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed approach is highly effective in discovering interesting community trend outliers.

#* ETM: Entity Topic Models for Mining Documents Associated with Entities

#! Topic models, which factor each document into different topics and represent each topic as a distribution of terms, have been widely and successfully used to better understand collections of text documents. However, documents are also associated with further information, such as the set of real-world entities mentioned in them. For example, news articles are usually related to several people, organizations, countries or locations. Since those associated entities carry rich information, it is highly desirable to build more expressive, entity-based topic models, which can capture the term distributions for each topic, each entity, as well as each topic-entity pair. In this paper, we therefore introduce a novel Entity Topic Model (ETM) for documents that are associated with a set of entities. ETM not only models the generative process of a term given its topic and entity information, but also models the correlation of entity term distributions and topic term distributions. A Gibbs sampling-based algorithm is proposed to learn the model. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over several state-of-the-art baselines.

#* Predicting Links in Multi-relational and Heterogeneous Networks

#! Link prediction is an important task in network analysis, benefiting researchers and organizations in a variety of fields. Many networks in the real world, for example social networks, are heterogeneous, having multiple types of links and complex dependency structures. Link prediction in such networks must model the influence propagating between heterogeneous relationships to achieve better link prediction performance than in homogeneous networks. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Relational Influence Propagation (MRIP), a novel probabilistic method for heterogeneous networks. We demonstrate that MRIP is useful for predicting links in sparse networks, which present a significant challenge due to the severe disproportion of the number of potential links to the number of real formed links. We also explore some factors that can inform the task of classification yet remain unexplored, such as temporal information. In this paper we make use of the temporal-related features by carefully investigating the issues of feasibility and generality. In accordance with our work in unsupervised learning, we further design an appropriate supervised approach in heterogeneous networks. Our experiments on co-authorship prediction demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
