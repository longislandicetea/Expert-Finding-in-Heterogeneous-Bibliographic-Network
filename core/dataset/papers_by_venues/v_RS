#! Recommender systems have emerged as an important part of the solution to the information overload problem facing today's Web users. Combining ideas and techniques from information filtering, user modeling, artificial intelligence, user interface design and human-computer interaction, recommender systems provide users with proactive suggestions that are tailored to meet their particular information needs and preferences. Indeed recommender systems have enjoyed considerable commercial success and continue to play an increasingly important role in many online services, from Amazon and iTunes to Tivo and Last.fm. It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the First ACM Recommender Systems conference, which builds on a wonderful legacy of research workshops and the Recommenders06 Summer School in Bilbao on the Present and Future of Recommender Systems. This conference brings together leaders in the field, from both research and practice, to explore the latest innovations, challenges, and opportunities for recommender systems technologies. The call for papers attracted 35 long paper submissions and 23 short paper submissions from 15 countries. After a detailed scientific review process the program committee selected 16 full-length papers (a 46% acceptance rate) and 14 short-papers (a 61% acceptance rate) for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference. In addition, the conference program includes a keynote presentation by Google's Krishna Bharat, the creator of Google News; two panel sessions filled with industry leaders sharing experiences and raising challenges for the research community; and industry-track submissions intended to provoke discussion. The conference also includes a doctoral symposium to provide an opportunity for doctoral students to explore and develop their research interests in an interdisciplinary workshop, under the guidance of a panel of distinguished research faculty.

#! Collaborative filtering has become an established method to measure users' similarity and to make predictions about their interests. However, prediction accuracy comes at the cost of user's privacy: in order to derive accurate similarity measures, users are required to share their rating history with each other. In this work we propose a new measure of similarity, which achieves comparable prediction accuracy to the Pearson correlation coefficient, and that can successfully be estimated without breaking users' privacy. This novel method works by estimating the number of concordant, discordant and tied pairs of ratings between two users with respect to a shared random set of ratings. In doing so, neither the items rated nor the ratings themselves are disclosed, thus achieving strictly-private collaborative filtering. The technique has been evaluated using the recently released Netflix prize dataset.

#! Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a powerful technique for generating personalized predictions. CF systems are typically based on a central storage of user profiles used for generating the recommendations. However, such centralized storage introduces a severe privacy breach, since the profiles may be accessed for purposes, possibly malicious, not related to the recommendation process. Recent researches proposed to protect the privacy of CF by distributing the profiles between multiple repositories and exchange only a subset of the profile data, which is useful for the recommendation. This work investigates how a decentralized distributed storage of user profiles combined with data modification techniques may mitigate some privacy issues. Results of experimental evaluation show that parts of the user profiles can be modified without hampering the accuracy of CF predictions. The experiments also indicate which parts of the user profiles are most useful for generating accurate CF predictions, while their exposure still keeps the essential privacy of the users.

#! Recommender Systems based on Collaborative Filtering suggest to users items they might like. However due to data sparsity of the input ratings matrix, the step of finding similar users often fails. We propose to replace this step with the use of a trust metric, an algorithm able to propagate trust over the trust network and to estimate a trust weight that can be used in place of the similarity weight. An empirical evaluation on Epinions.com dataset shows that Recommender Systems that make use of trust information are the most effective in term of accuracy while preserving a good coverage. This is especially evident on users who provided few ratings.

#! An attacker can draw attention to items that don't deserve that attention by manipulating recommender systems. We describe an influence-limiting algorithm that can turn existing recommender systems into manipulation-resistant systems. Honest reporting is the optimal strategy for raters who wish to maximize their influence. If an attacker can create only a bounded number of shills, the attacker can mislead only a small amount. However, the system eventually makes full use of information from honest, informative raters. We describe both the influence limits and the information loss incurred due to those limits in terms of information-theoretic concepts of loss functions and entropies.

#! User data scarcity has always been indicated among the major problems of collaborative filtering recommender systems. That is, if two users do not share sufficiently large set of items for whom their ratings are known, then the user-to-user similarity computation is not reliable and a rating prediction for one user can not be based on the ratings of the other. This paper shows that this problem can be solved, and that the accuracy of collaborative recommendations can be improved by: a) partitioning the collaborative user data into specialized and distributed repositories, and b) aggregating information coming from these repositories. This paper explores a content-dependent partitioning of collaborative movie ratings, where the ratings are partitioned according to the genre of the movie and presents an evaluation of four aggregation approaches. The evaluation demonstrates that the aggregation improves the accuracy of a centralized system containing the same ratings and proves the feasibility and advantages of a distributed collaborative filtering scenario.

#! This article presents an approach to automatically create virtual communities of users with similar music preferences in a distributed system. Our goal is to create personalized music channels for these communities using the content shared by its members in peer-to-peer networks for each community. To extract these communities a complex network theoretic approach is chosen. A fully connected graph of users is created using epidemic protocols. We show that the created graph sufficiently converges to a graph created with a centralized algorithm after a small number of protocol iterations. To find suitable techniques for creating user communities, we analyze graphs created from real-world recommender datasets and identify specific properties of these datasets. Based on these properties, different graph-based community-extraction techniques are chosen and evaluated. We select a technique that exploits identified properties to create clusters of music listeners. The suitability of this technique is validated using a music dataset and two large movie datasets. On a graph of 6,040 peers, the selected technique assigns at least 85% of the peers to optimal communities, and obtains a mean classification error of less than 0.05% over the remaining peers that are not assigned to the best community.

#! The widespread deployment of recommender systems has lead to user feedback of varying quality. While some users faithfully express their true opinion, many provide noisy ratings which can be detrimental to the quality of the generated recommendations. The presence of noise can violate modeling assumptions and may thus lead to instabilities in estimation and prediction. Even worse, malicious users can deliberately insert attack profiles in an attempt to bias the recommender system to their benefit. Robust statistics is an area within statistics where estimation methods have been developed that deteriorate more gracefully in the presence of unmodeled noise and slight departures from modeling assumptions. In this work, we study how such robust statistical methods, in particular M-estimators, can be used to generate stable recommendation even in the presence of noise and spam. To that extent, we present a Robust Matrix Factorization algorithm and study its stability. We conclude that M-estimators do not add significant stability to recommendation; however the presented algorithm can outperform existing recommendation algorithms in its recommendation quality.

#! Collaborative filtering (CF) is a successful approach for building online recommender systems. The fundamental process of the CF approach is to predict how a user would like to rate a given item based on the ratings of some nearest-neighbor users (user-based CF) or nearest-neighbor items (item-based CF). In the user-based CF approach, for example, the conventional prediction procedure is to find some nearest-neighbor users of the active user who have rated the given item, and then aggregate their rating information to predict the rating for the given item. In reality, due to the data sparseness, we have observed that a large proportion of users are filtered out because they don't rate the given item, even though they are very close to the active user. In this paper we present a recursive prediction algorithm, which allows those nearest-neighbor users to join the prediction process even if they have not rated the given item. In our approach, if a required rating value is not provided explicitly by the user, we predict it recursively and then integrate it into the prediction process. We study various strategies of selecting nearest-neighbor users for this recursive process. Our experiments show that the recursive prediction algorithm is a promising technique for improving the prediction accuracy for collaborative filtering recommender systems.

#! Consider a conversational product recommender system in which a user repeatedly edits and resubmits a query until she finds a product that she wants. We show how an advisor can: observe the user's actions; infer constraints on the user's utility function and add them to a user model; use the constraints to deduce which queries the user is likely to try next; and advise the user to avoid those that are unsatisfiable. We call this information recommendation. We give a detailed formulation of information recommendation for the case of products that are described by a set of Boolean features. Our experimental results show that if the user is given advice, the number of queries she needs to try before finding the product of highest utility is greatly reduced. We also show that an advisor that confines its advice to queries that the user model predicts are likely to be tried next will give shorter advice than one whose advice is unconstrained by the user model.

#! Recommender systems are increasingly being employed to personalize services, such as on the web, but also in electronics devices, such as personal video recorders. These recommenders learn a user profile, based on rating feedback from the user on, e.g., books, songs, or TV programs, and use machine learning techniques to infer the ratings of new items. The techniques commonly used are collaborative filtering and naive Bayesian classification, and they are known to have several problems, in particular the cold-start problem and its slow adaptivity to changing user preferences. These problems can be mitigated by allowing the user to set up or manipulate his profile. In this paper, we propose an extension to the naive Bayesian classifier that enhances user control. We do this by maintaining and flexibly integrating two profiles for a user, one learned by rating feedback, and one created by the user. We in particular show how the cold-start problem is mitigated.

#! Supporting conversational approaches in mobile recommender systems is challenging because of the inherent limitations of mobile devices and the dependence of produced recommendations on the context. In a previous work, we proposed a critique-based mobile recommendation approach and presented the results of a live users evaluation. Live-user evaluations are expensive and there we could not compare different system variants to check all our research hypotheses. In this paper, we present an innovative simulation methodology and its use in the comparison of different user-query representation approaches. Our simulation test procedure replays off-line, against different system variants, interactions recorded in the live-user evaluation. The results of the simulation tests show that the composite query representation, which employs both logical and similarity queries, does improve the recommendation performance over a representation using either a logical or a similarity query.

#! We consider a conversational recommender system based on example-critiquing where some recommendations are suggestions aimed at stimulating preference expression to acquire an accurate preference model. User studies show that suggestions are particularly effective when they present additional opportunities to the user according to the look-ahead principle [32]. This paper proposes a strategy for producing suggestions that exploits prior knowledge of preference distributions and can adapt relative to users' reactions to the displayed examples. We evaluate the approach with simulations using data acquired by previous interactions with real users. In two different settings, we measured the effects of prior knowledge and adaptation strategies with satisfactory results.

#! The increasing amount of content available via digital television has made TV program recommenders valuable tools. In order to provide personalized recommendations, recommender systems need to collect information about user preferences. Since users are reluctant to invest much time in explicitly expressing their interests, preferences often need to be implicitly inferred through data gathered by monitoring user behavior. Which is, alas, less reliable. This article addresses the problem of learning TV preferences based on tracking the programs users have watched, whilst dealing with the varying degrees of reliability in such information. Three approaches to the problem are discussed: use all information equally; weight information by its reliability or simply discard the most unreliable information. Experimental results for these three approaches are presented and compared using a content-based filtering recommender built on a Naïve Bayes classifier.

#! Standard memory-based collaborative filtering algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbor, are quite vulnerable to profile injection attacks. Previous work has shown that some model-based techniques are more robust than k-nn. Model abstraction can inhibit certain aspects of an attack, providing an algorithmic approach to minimizing attack effectiveness. In this paper, we examine the robustness of a recommendation algorithm based on the data mining technique of association rule mining. Our results show that the Apriori algorithm offers large improvement in stability and robustness compared to k-nearest neighbor and other model-based techniques we have studied. Furthermore, our results show that Apriori can achieve comparable recommendation accuracy to k-nn.

#! Information overload is no longer news; the explosive growth of the Internet has made this issue increasingly serious for Web users. Users are very often overwhelmed by the huge amount of information and are faced with a big challenge to find the most relevant information in the right time. Recommender systems aim at pruning this information space and directing users toward the items that best meet their needs and interests. Web Recommendation has been an active application area in Web Mining and Machine Learning research. In this paper we propose a novel machine learning perspective toward the problem, based on reinforcement learning. Unlike other recommender systems, our system does not use the static patterns discovered from web usage data, instead it learns to make recommendations as the actions it performs in each situation. We model the problem as Q-Learning while employing concepts and techniques commonly applied in the web usage mining domain. We propose that the reinforcement learning paradigm provides an appropriate model for the recommendation problem, as well as a framework in which the system constantly interacts with the user and learns from her behavior. Our experimental evaluations support our claims and demonstrate how this approach can improve the quality of web recommendations.

#! With recommender systems, users receive items recommended on the basis of their profile. New users experience the cold start problem: as their profile is very poor, the system performs very poorly. In this paper, classical new user cold start techniques are improved by exploiting the cold user data, i.e. the user data that is readily available (e.g. age, occupation, location, etc.), in order to automatically associate the new user with a better first profile. Relying on the existing α-community spaces model, a rule-based induction process is used and a recommendation process based on the "level of agreement" principle is defined. The experiments show that the quality of recommendations compares to that obtained after a classical new user technique, while the new user effort is smaller as no initial ratings are asked.

#! Recommender systems estimate the conditional probability P(χj|χi) of item χj being bought, given that a customer has already purchased item χi. While there are different ways of approximating this conditional probability, the expression is generally taken to refer to the frequency of co-occurrence of items in the same basket, or other user-specific item lists, rather than being seen as the co-occurrence of χj with χi as a proportion of all other items bought alongside χi. This paper proposes a probabilistic calculus for the calculation of conditionals based on item rather than basket counts. The proposed method has the consequence that items bough together as part of small baskets are more predictive of each other than if they co-occur in large baskets. Empirical results suggests that this may result in better take-up of personalised recommendations.

We used applied ethnography, on-location interviewing and observation, to get an accurate picture of user activity. We were especially interested in the role of customer ratings and reviews and what kind of strategies users had developed for such an environment. Our results underline the need to develop recommender systems as a whole. The way the recommendations are shown affects which items get picked, and for improving the interface, it is necessary to study the whole in addition to studying the parts in isolation.

#! In order to learn a user's preferences in collaborative recommender systems it is crucial to select the most informative items for a user to rate. For example, rating a popular item will provide little discriminative information about user's preferences since most users like popular items. Existing approaches select the most informative items based primarily on items' uncertainty, but tend to ignore an important metric of coverage - the number of items for which we are able to accurately estimate preferences. Selecting an item based only on uncertainty will reduce the uncertainty of the selected item, but will not necessarily reduce the uncertainty of other items - which is the ultimate goal. Therefore, in order to reduce the uncertainty over all items, we propose to select items that are not only uncertain but are also influential. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach.

In this working paper we present Eigentaste 5.0, a constant-time recommender system that dynamically adapts the order that items are recommended by integrating user clustering with item clustering and monitoring item portfolio effects. This extends our Eigentaste 2.0 algorithm, which uses principal component analysis to cluster users offline. In preliminary experiments we backtested Eigentaste 5.0 on data collected from Jester, our online joke recommender system. Results suggest that it will perform better than Eigentaste 2.0. The new algorithm also uses item clusters to address the cold-start problem for introducing new items.

#! We report the results of a Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) study comparing two approaches to presenting information in a spoken dialogue system generating flight recommendations. We found that recommendations presented using the user-model based summarize and refine (UMSR) approach enable more efficient information retrieval than the data-driven summarize and refine (SR) approach. In addition, user ratings on four evaluation criteria showed a clear preference for recommendations based on the UMSR approach.

#! The paper presents a method that uses aggregate ratings provided by various segments of users for various categories of items to derive better estimations of unknown individual ratings. This is achieved by converting the aggregate ratings into constraints on the parameters of a rating estimation model presented in the paper. The paper also demonstrates theoretically that these additional constraints reduce rating estimation errors resulting in better rating predictions.

#! In support of social interaction and information sharing, online communities commonly provide interfaces for users to form or interact with groups. For example, a user of the social music recommendation site last.fm might join the "First Wave Punk" group to discuss his or her favorite band (The Clash) and listen to playlists generated by fellow fans. Clustering techniques provide the potential to automatically discover groups of users who appear to share interests. We explore this idea by describing algorithms for clustering users of an online community and automatically describing the resulting user groups. We designed these techniques for use in an online recommendation system with no pre-existing group functionality, which led us to develop an "activity-balanced clustering" algorithm that considers both user activity and user interests in forming clusters.

#! The critiquing-based recommender system mainly aims to guide users to make an accurate and confident decision, while requiring them to consume a low level of effort. We have previously found that the hybrid critiquing system of combining the strengths from both system-proposed critiques and user self-motivated critiquing facility can highly improve users' subjective perceptions such as their decision confidence and trusting intentions. In this paper, we continue to investigate how to further reduce users' objective decision effort (e.g. time consumption) in such system by increasing the critique prediction accuracy of the system-proposed critiques. By means of real user evaluation, we proved that a new hybrid critiquing system design that integrates the preference-based recommendations organization technique for critiques suggestion can effectively help to increase the proposed critiques' application frequency and significantly contribute to saving users' task time and interaction effort.

Too often recommender systems are seen as black box systems, resulting in general perplexity and dissatisfaction from users who are treated as passive, isolated consumers. Recent literature observes that recommendations rarely occur within such isolation and that there may be potential within more socially-orientated approaches. With KeepUP, we outline the design of a recommendation process that is based on an implicit social network where the relevancy and meaning of information can be negotiated not only with the recommender system but also with other users. Our overall goal is to support the formation and development of online communities of interest.

The online information retrieval process cross different repositories shares similarities with content access facilities and user behaviors even when containing inherently different content types. In this work, we introduce our social recommender system called ASSIST. The recommendation framework in ASSIST can be applied to any online information retrieval service with key information access components, search and browsing. ASSIST exploits multiple forms of social implicit feedback in order to generate well-informed user recommendations in the online information retrieval domain.

#! There are a number of online systems where people can, in effect, recommend themselves, or more precisely, represent themselves in ways that may motivate others to seek them out for conversations, business ventures, dates and a variety of other types of interactions and relationships. Several of these systems offer capabilities for people to create profiles of themselves and algorithms for matching profiles to recommend one person to another. When a group of people is gathered together in a physical space, for the purpose of renewing connections or creating new ones, new challenges emerge with respect to which dimensions of people's online representations to inject into that space - how, where and when to recommend whom to whom. This paper briefly describes some experiences and ongoing challenges encountered in determining how best to bridge the gaps between people by bridging the gaps between people's online representations of themselves and their presence in physical space.

#! Recommendation systems leverage several types of information relating to a recommendable item. The recommendation methods are often based on the analysis of how a set of users associate or rate a given set of items, but they can also focus on the analysis of how the content of the items is related. This paper discusses a hybrid recommendation system for music - a system that leverages both spectral graph properties of an item-based collaborative filtering association network as well as acoustic features of the underlying music signal. Both features are balanced appropriately and used to disambiguate the music-seeking intentions of a user.

Agents work as experts cooperating and communicating to each other in the recommendation process. Each agent has a truth maintenance system (TMS) component that helps the agents to keep the integrity of their knowledge bases.

#! When people are seeking information they are interested in, they need time, need to know exactly what they are looking for and require attention capacities to check different sources. Recommender systems help to overcome the information overflow and filter out irrelevant sources by comparing different types of information and selecting the best results in consideration of customer preferences. Therefore accurate customer profiles are necessary which nowadays do not exist. In a mobile environment customers are not willing to spend time on disclosing their preferences; maybe they are not aware of them or have difficulties to respond to system requests. The paper in hand follows recommendations by critiquing to improve profiling quality but instead of collecting information, the transparent communication of profile extensions is focused. The customer can add preferences to his profile without explicitly expressing. Furthermore, the connection between proposed preferences and the systems conclusion behind is visible.

#! This paper gives an extended abstract of the dissertation work seeking to find how social information retrieval can enhance the discovery and reuse of digital educational content. A social bookmarking and tagging tool, that is used in a multi-lingual and multi-cultural context of Europe, is introduced to teachers. We intend to use this information to create social information retrieval mechanisms that allow flexible access to large-scale collections of digital educational content. A first step towards studying the design and implementation of such systems is to understand more about tagging in multiple languages, its underlying data structures, and how multi-lingual tags and annotations can be leveraged for social information retrieval, such as for a recommender and a social navigation system. Thereafter, we plan to study their acceptance, use and usefulness. Moreover, our goal is to make the discovery of digital educational content more useful and efficient for teachers by studying the relationship between different information seeking tasks and retrieval methods. We believe that this can facilitate, support and enhance the everyday tasks of teachers and learners when interacting with digital content for education.

#! Recommender systems have emerged as an important part of the solution to the information overload problem facing today's Web users. Combining ideas and techniques from information filtering, user modeling, artificial intelligence, user interface design and human-computer interaction, recommender systems provide users with proactive suggestions that are tailored to meet their particular information needs and preferences. Indeed recommender systems have enjoyed considerable commercial success and continue to play an increasingly important role in many online services, from Amazon and Yahoo! to iTunes and Last.fm. It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Second ACM International Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys), which builds on a wonderful legacy of research workshops, the Recommenders Summer School held in Bilbao in 2006, and the First ACM International Conference on Recommender Systems held in Minneapolis in 2007. This conference brings together leaders in the field, from both research and practice, to explore the latest innovations, challenges, and opportunities for recommender systems technologies. The call for papers attracted 121 submissions, a more than 100% increase compared to 2007, with authors from nearly 30 different countries. After a detailed scientific review process the program committee selected 38 papers for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference, a 31% acceptance rate. Of these 38 papers, 20 full-length papers were accepted for oral presentation and 18 papers for poster presentation, of which 15 were full-length papers and 3 were short-papers. In addition, the conference program includes a keynote presentation by Yahoo!'s Andrei Broder; two panel sessions filled with industry leaders sharing experiences and raising challenges for the research community; and presentations of six early-stage recommender start-ups, each bidding to win a $100,000 prize from Strands, Inc. The conference also includes three tutorials, in which leaders of the field explore hot topics in more detail; and a doctoral symposium to provide an opportunity for doctoral students to explore and develop their research interests in an interdisciplinary workshop, under the guidance of a panel of distinguished research faculty.

#* Computational advertising and recommender systems
#@ Andrei Z. Broder
#t 2008
#c 9
#! Computational advertising is an emerging scientific discipline, at the intersection of large scale search and text analysis, information retrieval, statistical modeling, machine learning, optimization, and microeconomics. The central challenge of computational advertising is to find the "best match" between a given user in a given context and a suitable advertisement. The context could be a user entering a query in a search engine ("sponsored search"), a user reading a web page ("content match" and "display ads"), a user conversing on a cell phone ("mobile advertising"), and so on. The information about the user can vary from scarily detailed to practically nil. The number of potential advertisements might be in the billions. Thus, depending on the definition of "best match" this challenge leads to a variety of massive optimization and search problems, with complicated constraints. The main part of this talk will give an introduction to computational advertising and present some illustrative research. In the second part we will discuss connections to recommender systems and present a couple of open problems of potential interest to both communities.

#! User-based collaborative filtering methods typically predict a user's item ratings as a weighted average of the ratings given by similar users, where the weight is proportional to the user similarity. Therefore, the accuracy of user similarity is the key to the success of the recommendation, both for selecting neighborhoods and computing predictions. However, the computed similarities between users are somewhat inaccurate due to data sparsity. For a given user, the set of neighbors selected for predicting ratings on different items typically exhibit overlap. Thus, error terms contributing to rating predictions will tend to be shared, leading to correlation of the prediction errors. Through a set of case studies, we discovered that for a given user, the prediction errors on different items are correlated to the similarities of the corresponding items, and to the degree to which they share common neighbors. We propose a framework to improve prediction accuracy based on these statistical prediction errors. Two different strategies to estimate the prediction error on a desired item are proposed. Our experiments show that these approaches improve the prediction accuracy of standard user based methods significantly, and they outperform other state-of-the-art methods.

#! The paper studies the Long Tail problem of recommender systems when many items in the Long Tail have only few ratings, thus making it hard to use them in recommender systems. The approach presented in the paper splits the whole itemset into the head and the tail parts and clusters only the tail items. Then recommendations for the tail items are based on the ratings in these clusters and for the head items on the ratings of individual items. If such partition and clustering are done properly, we show that this reduces the recommendation error rates for the tail items, while maintaining reasonable computational performance.

This allows the model to use content information to recommend items that are not seen during training. We describe a tractable algorithm for training the model, and give experimental results evaluating the model in two cold start recommendation tasks on the MovieLens data set.

#! We focus on collaborative filtering dealing with self-organizing communities, host mobility, wireless access, and ad-hoc communications. In such a domain, knowledge representation and users profiling can be hard; remote servers can be often unreachable due to client mobility; and feedback ratings collected during random connections to other users' ad-hoc devices can be useless, because of natural differences between human beings. Our approach is based on so called Affinity Networks, and on a novel system, called MobHinter, that epidemically spreads recommendations through spontaneous similarities between users. Main results of our study are two fold: firstly, we show how to reach comparable recommendation accuracies in the mobile domain as well as in a complete knowledge scenario; secondly, we propose epidemic collaborative strategies that can reduce rapidly and realistically the cold start problem.

#! Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords, to annotate and categorize information items (songs, pictures, web links, products etc.). Collaborative tagging systems recommend tags to users based on what tags other users have used for the same items, aiming to develop a common consensus about which tags best describe an item. However, they fail to provide appropriate tag recommendations, because: (i) users may have different interests for an information item and (ii) information items may have multiple facets. In contrast to the current tag recommendation algorithms, our approach develops a unified framework to model the three types of entities that exist in a social tagging system: users, items and tags. These data is represented by a 3-order tensor, on which latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction is performed using the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) technique. We perform experimental comparison of the proposed method against two state-of-the-art tag recommendations algorithms with two real data sets (Last.fm and BibSonomy). Our results show significant improvements in terms of effectiveness measured through recall/precision.

#! Social (or folksonomic) tagging has become a very popular way to describe, categorise, search, discover and navigate content within Web 2.0 websites. Unlike taxonomies, which overimpose a hierarchical categorisation of content, folksonomies empower end users by enabling them to freely create and choose the categories (in this case, tags) that best describe some content. However, as tags are informally defined, continually changing, and ungoverned, social tagging has often been criticised for lowering, rather than increasing, the efficiency of searching, due to the number of synonyms, homonyms, polysemy, as well as the heterogeneity of users and the noise they introduce. In this paper, we propose Social Ranking, a method that exploits recommender system techniques to increase the efficiency of searches within Web 2.0. We measure users' similarity based on their past tag activity. We infer tags' relationships based on their association to content. We then propose a mechanism to answer a user's query that ranks (recommends) content based on the inferred semantic distance of the query to the tags associated to such content, weighted by the similarity of the querying user to the users who created those tags. A thorough evaluation conducted on the CiteULike dataset demonstrates that Social Ranking neatly improves coverage, while not compromising on accuracy.

#! Traditional social networking sites allow users to enter responses to a set of predefined fields when populating their personal profiles. In the system discussed in this work, freeform 'About You' entries allow users to craft their own questions / topics. We found that this kind of flexibility often leads to low content contributions and infrequent updates. The 'About You' recommender system described in this paper differs from many recommender systems in that it recommends content for users to create, rather than consume. We present empirical data from an experiment with 2,000 users of a social networking site during a one month period. Our findings suggest that users who receive recommendations create more entries and update them more over time. Further, using articulated social network information for recommendations performed better than content-based matching.

#! We study the problem of personalized, interactive tag recommendation for Flickr: While a user enters/selects new tags for a particular picture, the system suggests related tags to her, based on the tags that she or other people have used in the past along with (some of) the tags already entered. The suggested tags are dynamically updated with every additional tag entered/selected. We describe a new algorithm, called Hybrid, which can be applied to this problem, and show that it outperforms previous algorithms. It has only a single tunable parameter, which we found to be very robust. Apart from this new algorithm and its detailed analysis, our main contributions are (i) a clean methodology which leads to conservative performance estimates, (ii) showing how classical classification algorithms can be applied to this problem, (iii) introducing a new cost measure, which captures the effort of the whole tagging process, (iv) clearly identifying, when purely local schemes (using only a user's tagging history) can or cannot be improved by global schemes (using everybody's tagging history).

#! We present a cross-cultural user evaluation of an organization-based product recommender interface, by comparing it with the traditional list view. The results show that it performed significantly better, for all study participants, in improving on their competence perceptions, including perceived recommendation quality, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, and positively impacting users' behavioral intentions such as intention to save effort in the next visit. Additionally, oriental users were observed reacting more significantly strongly to the organization interface regarding some subjective aspects, compared to western subjects. Through this user study, we also identified the dominating role of the recommender system's decision-aiding competence in stimulating both oriental and western users' return intention to an e-commerce website where the system is applied.

#! We propose a new recommendation algorithm for online documents, images and videos, which is personalized. Our idea is to rely on the attention time of individual users captured through commodity eye-tracking as the essential clue. The prediction of user interest over a certain online item (a document, image or video) is based on the user's attention time acquired using vision-based commodity eye-tracking during his previous reading, browsing or video watching sessions over the same type of online materials. After acquiring a user's attention times over a collection of online materials, our algorithm can predict the user's probable attention time over a new online item through data mining. Based on our proposed algorithm, we have developed a new online content recommender system for documents, images and videos. The recommendation results produced by our algorithm are evaluated by comparing with those manually labeled by users as well as by commercial search engines including Google (Web) Search, Google Image Search and YouTube.

#! A new ontological-content-based method for ranking the relevancy of items in the electronic newspapers domain is proposed. The method is being implemented in ePaper, a personalized electronic newspaper research project. The content-based part of the filtering method of ePaper utilizes a hierarchical ontology of news items. The method considers common and "close" ontology concepts appearing in the user's profile and in the item's profile, measuring the hierarchical distance between concepts in the two profiles. Based on the number of common and related concepts, and their distances from each other, the filtering algorithm computes the similarity between items and users, and rank-orders the news items according to their relevancy to each user, thus providing a personalized newspaper. We have conducted evaluations of the filtering method, examining various parameters. A group of subjects, each having defined an initial content-based profile using the news ontology concepts, read news items from a certain electronic newspaper and expressed the relevancy of each item to them. In different runs of the algorithm on the same data, we changed several parameters of the algorithm, and compared the results with the users' ratings. We discovered that the filtering method, which considers not only common concepts but also hierarchically related concepts, yields significantly better quality of filtering compared to using only common concepts. Moreover, we were able to find optimal values of similarity scores according to the hierarchical distance between related concepts.

#! With the fast development of web 2.0, user-centric publishing and knowledge management platforms, such as Wiki, Blogs, and Q & A systems attract a large number of users. Given the availability of the huge amount of meaningful user generated content, incremental model based recommendation techniques can be employed to improve users' experience using automatic recommendations. In this paper, we propose an incremental recommendation algorithm based on Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA). The proposed algorithm can consider not only the users' long-term and short-term interests, but also users' negative and positive feedback. We compare the proposed method with several baseline methods using a real-world Question & Answer website called Wenda. Experiments demonstrate both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed methods.

#! Frequent itemset mining (FIM) is a useful tool for discovering frequently co-occurrent items. Since its inception, a number of significant FIM algorithms have been developed to speed up mining performance. Unfortunately, when the dataset size is huge, both the memory use and computational cost can still be prohibitively expensive. In this work, we propose to parallelize the FP-Growth algorithm (we call our parallel algorithm PFP) on distributed machines. PFP partitions computation in such a way that each machine executes an independent group of mining tasks. Such partitioning eliminates computational dependencies between machines, and thereby communication between them. Through empirical study on a large dataset of 802,939 Web pages and 1,021,107 tags, we demonstrate that PFP can achieve virtually linear speedup. Besides scalability, the empirical study demonstrates that PFP to be promising for supporting query recommendation for search engines.

#! Critique-based conversational recommender systems are becoming common place, facilitating richer dialogues with the user than pure content-based or collaborative approaches. Most implementations of these systems combine similarity-based reasoning with constraints to enable users express preferences as critiques of products. Critiques are simple statements like "I like this product, but would prefer one that is less expensive". In this paper we exploit the fact that the repertoire of critiques available to the user is usually known ahead of interaction time to construct a critique graph representation of a catalogue. The critique graph provides a formal basis for reasoning about the set of products that can be reached using critiques from a given product. We introduce the concepts of product cover, support sets of products and catalogue cover. The latter is defined as a set of products from which all products in a catalogue can be reached using a specified best-case maximum number of critiques. We show that for the catalogues we considered, catalogue covers are typically small. We show that the sizes and distributions of product covers and support sets can be used to inform us of the structure of a catalogue and the challenges it would present for interactive navigation. We also propose the notion of a minimum catalogue cover as a set of "entry products" that ensure that all products in the catalogue can be reached by critiquing.

#! This paper proposes a framework for Composite Alternative Recommendation Development (CARD), which supports composite product and service definitions, top-k decision optimization, and dynamic preference learning. Composite services are characterized by a set of sub-services, which, in turn, can be composite or atomic. Each atomic and composite service is associated with metrics, such as cost, duration, and enjoyment ranking. The framework is based on the Composite Recommender Knowledge Base, which is composed of views, including Service Metric Views that specify services and their metrics; Recommendation Views that specify the ranking definition to balance optimality and diversity; parametric Transformers that specify how service metrics are defined in terms of metrics of its subservices; and learning sets from which the unknown parameters in the transformers are iteratively learned. Also introduced in the paper is the top-k selection criterion that, based on a vector of utility metrics, provides the balance between the optimality of individual metrics and the diversity of recommendations. To exemplify the framework, specific views are developed for a travel package recommender system.

#! Collaborative Filtering is one of the most widely used approaches in recommendation systems which predicts user preferences by learning past user-item relationships. In recent years, item-oriented collaborative filtering methods came into prominence as they are more scalable compared to user-oriented methods. Item-oriented methods discover item-item relationships from the training data and use these relations to compute predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel item-oriented algorithm, Random Walk Recommender, that first infers transition probabilities between items based on their similarities and models finite length random walks on the item space to compute predictions. This method is especially useful when training data is less than plentiful, namely when typical similarity measures fail to capture actual relationships between items. Aside from the proposed prediction algorithm, the final transition probability matrix computed in one of the intermediate steps can be used as an item similarity matrix in typical item-oriented approaches. Thus, this paper suggests a method to enhance similarity matrices under sparse data as well. Experiments on MovieLens data show that Random Walk Recommender algorithm outperforms two other item-oriented methods in different sparsity levels while having the best performance difference in sparse datasets.

#! Recommender Systems (RS) have become popular for their ability to make useful suggestions to online shoppers. Knowledge-based RS represent one branch of these types of applications that employ means-end knowledge to map abstract user requirements to product characteristics. Before setting up such a system, the knowledge has to be acquired from domain experts and formalized using constraints or a comparable representation mechanism. However, the initial acquisition of the knowledge base and its maintenance are effort intensive tasks. Here, we propose a system that learns rule-based preferences from successful interactions in historic transaction data. It is realized as a meta-level hybrid that employs collaborative filtering to derive preferences from a user's nearest neighbors that are processed by a knowledge-based RS to derive recommendations. An evaluation using a commercial dataset showed that this approach outperforms the prediction accuracy of a knowledge base provided by domain experts. In addition, the approach is applicable for supporting domain experts in the maintenance and validation tasks associated with providing personalization knowledge bases.

#! Attackers may seek to manipulate recommender systems in order to promote or suppress certain items. Existing defenses based on analysis of ratings also discard useful information from honest raters. In this paper, we show that this is unavoidable and provide a lower bound on how much information must be discarded. We use an information-theoretic framework to exhibit a fundamental tradeoff between manipulation-resistance and optimal use of genuine ratings in recommender systems. We define a recommender system to be (n, c)-robust if an attacker with n sybil identities cannot cause more than a limited amount c units of damage to predictions. We prove that any robust recommender system must also discard Ω(log (n/c)) units of useful information from each genuine rater.

#! Trust, reputation and recommendation are key components of successful e-commerce systems. However, e-commerce systems are also vulnerable in this respect because there are opportunities for sellers to gain advantage through manipulation of reputation and recommendation. One such vulnerability is the use of fraudulent user profiles to boost (or damage) the ratings of items in an online recommender system. In this paper we cast this problem as a problem of detecting anomalous structure in network analysis and propose a novel mechanism for detecting this anomalous structure. We present an evaluation that shows that this approach is effective at uncovering the types of recommender systems attack described in the literature.

#! Basic content personalization consists in matching up the attributes of a user profile, in which preferences and interests are stored, with the attributes of a content object. The Web 2.0 (r)evolution and the advent of user generated content have changed the game for personalization, since the role of people has evolved from passive consumers of information to that of active contributors. One of the forms of user generated content that has drawn more attention from the research community is folksonomy, a taxonomy generated by users who collaboratively annotate and categorize resources of interests with freely chosen keywords called tags. In this paper, we investigate whether folksonomies might be a valuable source of information about user interests. The main contribution is a strategy that enables a content-based recommender to infer user interests by applying machine learning techniques both on the "official" item descriptions provided by a publisher, and on tags which users adopt to freely annotate relevant items. Static content and tags are preventively analyzed by advanced linguistic techniques in order to capture the semantics of the user interests often hidden behind keywords. The proposed approach has been evaluated in the context of cultural heritage personalization. Preliminary experiments involving 30 real users show an improvement in the predictive accuracy of the tag-augmented recommender compared to the pure content-based one.

#! This paper presents two methods, named Item- and User-centric, to evaluate the quality of novel recommendations. The former method focuses on analyzing the item-based recommendation network. The aim is to detect whether the network topology has any pathology that hinders novel recommendations. The latter, user-centric evaluation, aims at measuring users' perceived quality of novel, previously unknown, recommendations. The results of the experiments, done in the music recommendation context, show that last.fm social recommender, based on collaborative filtering, is prone to popularity bias. This has direct consequences on the topology of the item-based recommendation network. Pure audio content-based methods (CB) are not affected by popularity. However, a user-centric experiment done with 288 subjects shows that even though a social-based approach recommends less novel items than our CB, users' perceived quality is better than those recommended by a pure CB method.

#! Recommender systems try to address the "new user problem" by quickly and painlessly learning user preferences so that users can begin receiving recommendations as soon as possible. We take an expanded perspective on the new user experience, seeing it as an opportunity to elicit valuable contributions to the community and shape subsequent user behavior. We conducted a field experiment in MovieLens where we imposed additional work on new users: not only did they have to rate movies, they also had to enter varying numbers of tags. While requiring more work led to fewer users completing the entry process, the benefits were significant: the remaining users produced a large volume of tags initially, and continued to enter tags at a much higher rate than a control group. Further, their rating behavior was not depressed. Our results suggest that careful design of the initial user experience can lead to significant benefits for an online community.

#! In content- and knowledge-based recommender systems often a measure of (dis)similarity between items is used. Frequently, this measure is based on the attributes of the items. However, which attributes are important for the users of the system remains an important question to answer. In this paper, we present an approach to determine attribute weights in a dissimilarity measure using clickstream data of an e-commerce website. Counted is how many times products are sold and based on this a Poisson regression model is estimated. Estimates of this model are then used to determine the attribute weights in the dissimilarity measure. We show an application of this approach on a product catalog of MP3 players provided by Compare Group, owner of the Dutch price comparison site http://www.vergelijk.nl, and show how the dissimilarity measure can be used to improve 2D product catalog visualizations.

#! CourseRank is a course planning tool aimed at helping students at Stanford. Recommendations comprise an integral part of it. However, implementing existing recommendation methods leads to fixed recommendations that cannot adapt to each particular student's changing requirements and do not help exploit the full extent of the available learning opportunities at the university. In this paper, we describe the concept of a flexible recommendation workflow, i.e., a high-level description of a parameterized process for computing recommendations. The input parameters of a flexible recommendation process comprise the "knobs" that control the final output and hence generate flexible recommendations. We describe how flexible recommendations can be expressed over a relational database and we present our prototype system that allows defining and executing different, fully-parameterized, recommendation workflows over relational data. Finally, we describe a user interface in CourseRank that allows students customize recommendations.

After more than a decade of widespread use, researchers and system users still debate whether such "impersonal" recommender systems actually perform as well as human recommenders. We compare the performance of MovieLens algorithmic predictions with the recommendations made, based on the same user profiles, by active MovieLens users. We found that algorithmic collaborative filtering outperformed humans on average, though some individuals outperformed the system substantially and humans on average outperformed the system on certain prediction tasks.

#! Recommender systems, based on collaborative filtering, draw their strength from techniques that manipulate a set of user-rating profiles in order to compute predicted ratings of unrated items. There are a wide range of techniques that can be applied to this problem; however, the k-nearest neighbour (kNN) algorithm has become the dominant method used in this context. Much research to date has focused on improving the performance of this algorithm, without considering the properties that emerge from manipulating the user data in this way. In order to understand the effect of kNN on a user-rating dataset, the algorithm can be viewed as a process that generates a graph, where nodes are users and edges connect similar users: the algorithm generates an implicit social network amongst the system subscribers. Temporal updates of the recommender system will impose changes on the graph. In this work we analyse user-user kNN graphs from a temporal perspective, retrieving characteristics such as dataset growth, the evolution of similarity between pairs of users, the volatility of user neighbourhoods over time, and emergent properties of the entire graph as the algorithm parameters change. These insights explain why certain kNN parameters and similarity measures outperform others, and show that there is a surprising degree of structural similarity between these graphs and explicit user social networks.

#! Our goal is to support system developers in rapid prototyping recommender systems using Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) techniques. In this paper we describe how jCOLIBRI can serve to that goal. jCOLIBRI is an object-oriented framework in Java for building CBR systems that greatly benefits from the reuse of previously developed CBR systems. jCOLIBRI includes a case base of templates for case-based recommender systems that can be easily adapted to prototype a great variety of alternatives. We describe the contents of the case base and show experimental results from our experience using the recommender templates case base with mid-size projects from undergraduate students.

#! Regularized matrix factorization models are known to generate high quality rating predictions for recommender systems. One of the major drawbacks of matrix factorization is that once computed, the model is static. For real-world applications dynamic updating a model is one of the most important tasks. Especially when ratings on new users or new items come in, updating the feature matrices is crucial. In this paper, we generalize regularized matrix factorization (RMF) to regularized kernel matrix factorization (RKMF). Kernels provide a flexible method for deriving new matrix factorization methods. Furthermore with kernels nonlinear interactions between feature vectors are possible. We propose a generic method for learning RKMF models. From this method we derive an online-update algorithm for RKMF models that allows to solve the new-user/new-item problem. Our evaluation indicates that our proposed online-update methods are accurate in approximating a full retrain of a RKMF model while the runtime of online-updating is in the range of milliseconds even for huge datasets like Netflix.

#! Collaborative tagging applications allow Internet users to annotate resources with personalized tags. The complex network created by many annotations, often called a folksonomy, permits users the freedom to explore tags, resources or even other user's profiles unbound from a rigid predefined conceptual hierarchy. However, the freedom afforded users comes at a cost: an uncontrolled vocabulary can result in tag redundancy and ambiguity hindering navigation. Data mining techniques, such as clustering, provide a means to remedy these problems by identifying trends and reducing noise. Tag clusters can also be used as the basis for effective personalized recommendation assisting users in navigation. We present a personalization algorithm for recommendation in folksonomies which relies on hierarchical tag clusters. Our basic recommendation framework is independent of the clustering method, but we use a context-dependent variant of hierarchical agglomerative clustering which takes into account the user's current navigation context in cluster selection. We present extensive experimental results on two real world dataset. While the personalization algorithm is successful in both cases, our results suggest that folksonomies encompassing only one topic domain, rather than many topics, present an easier target for recommendation, perhaps because they are more focused and often less sparse. Furthermore, context dependent cluster selection, an integral step in our personalization algorithm, demonstrates more utility for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies than in single-topic folksonomies. This observation suggests that topic selection is an important strategy for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies.

#! Collaborative filtering (CF) approaches proved to be effective for recommender systems in predicting user preferences in item selection using known user ratings of items. This subfield of machine learning has gained a lot of popularity with the Netflix Prize competition started in October 2006. Two major approaches for this problem are matrix factorization (MF) and the neighbor based approach (NB). In this work, we propose various variants of MF and NB that can boost the performance of the usual ensemble based scheme. First, we investigate various regularization scenarios for MF. Second, we introduce two NB methods: one is based on correlation coefficients and the other on linear least squares. At the experimentation part, we show that the proposed approaches compare favorably with existing ones in terms of prediction accuracy and/or required training time. We present results of blending the proposed methods.

#! We present a flexible approach to collaborative filtering which stems from basic research results. The approach is flexible in several dimensions: We introduce an algorithm where the loss can be tailored to a particular recommender problem. This allows us to optimize the prediction quality in a way that matters for the specific recommender system. The introduced algorithm can deal with structured estimation of the predictions for one user. The most prominent outcome of this is the ability of learning to rank items along user preferences. To this end, we also present a novel algorithm to compute the ordinal loss in O(n log(n)) as apposed to O(n2). We extend this basic model such that it can accommodate user and item offsets as well as user and item features if they are present. The latter unifies collaborative filtering with content based filtering. We present an analysis of the algorithm which shows desirable properties in terms of privacy needs of users, parallelization of the algorithm as well as collaborative filtering as a service. We evaluate the algorithm on data provided by WikiLens. This data is a cross-domain data set as it contains ratings on items from a vast array of categories. Evaluation shows that cross-domain prediction is possible.

#! Search engines are among the most-used resources on the internet. However, even today's most successful search engines struggle to provide high quality search results. According to recent studies as many as 50 percent of web search sessions fail to find any relevant results for the searcher. Researchers have proposed social search techniques, in which early searchers provide feedback that is used to improve relevance for later searchers. In this paper we investigate foundational questions of social search. In particular, we directly assess the degree of agreement among users about the relevance ranking of search results. We developed a simulated search engine interface that systematically randomizes Google's normal relevance ordering of the items presented to users. Our results show that (a) people are biased toward items in the top of the search lists, even if the list is randomized; (b) people explicit feedback is not biased and (c) people's shared preferences do not always agree with Google's result order. These results suggest that social search techniques might improve the effectiveness of web search engines.

#! Recommender systems have recently grown in popularity both in e-commerce and in research. However, there is little, if any, direct evidence in the literature of the value of recommender systems to e-Businesses, especially relating to consumer packaged goods (CPG) sold in a supermarket setting. We have been working in collaboration with LeShop (www.LeShop.ch), to gather real evidence of the added business value of a personalised recommender system. In this paper, we present our initial evaluation of the performance of our model-based personalised recommender systems over the 21-month period from May 2006 to January 2008, with particular focus on the added-value to the business. Our analysis covers shopper penetration, as well as the direct and indirect extra revenue generated by our recommender systems. One of the key lessons we have learnt during this case study is that the effect of a recommender system extends far beyond the direct extra revenue generated from the purchase of recommended items. The importance of maintaining updated model files was also found to be key to maintaining the performance of such model-based systems.

#! Recommender Systems help an on-line user to tame information overload and are being used now in complex domains where it could be beneficial to exploit context-awareness, e.g., in travel recommendation. Technically, in Recommender Systems we can interpret context as a set of constraints or preferences over the usage of items determined by the contextual conditions (e.g., today it is raining or the user is in a particular location). In fact, there is a lack of approaches to deal effectively with contextual data. This thesis investigates some approaches to exploit context in Recommender Systems. It provides a general architecture of context-aware Recommender Systems and analyzes separate components of this model. The main focus is to investigate new approaches that can bring a real added value to users. In this paper I also describe my initial results on item selection and item weighting for context-dependent Collaborative Filtering (CF). Moreover, I shall present my ongoing research on CF hybridization using context.

#! The analysis, design and maintenance of Web sites involves two significant challenges: managing the services and content available, and secondly, making the site dynamically adequate to user's needs. These challenges can be addressed by automating several of the management activities of a Web site. In this work we propose to develop a platform that can be used for that purpose, which is independent of the Web site. We started by developing a data warehouse that stores data about the usage, content and structure of a Web site. We have also developed a tool that uses the data in the data warehouse and provides information to the editor to monitor the activity on the Web site as well as the site itself. We have recently begun to develop multidimensional recommender systems that take advantage of the wealth of the data in the data warehouse. Both simulated and live tests are carried out to test the platform.

#! This paper offers an extended abstract of a PhD project that focuses on supporting learners in finding most suitable learning activities in informal learning environments. For this purpose we aim to develop a personal recommender system, which will recommend most suitable learning activities to learners regarding their personal needs and preferences. As a theoretical framework for informal learning environments we use the concept of Learning Networks [1]. Learning Networks can be filled with lots of learning activities stemming from different providers. Such networks are dynamic, because each member could add or delete content at any time. A personal recommender system is needed to support learners in selecting learning activities from a Learning Network that will enable them to achieve their learning goals in a specific domain. It is expected that such support will minimize the amount of time learners need for finding suitable learning activities. A better alignment of the characteristics of learners and learning activities is expected to increase both effectiveness and efficiency of learning progress of the learners.

#! One of the goals in recommender systems is to recommend those items to each user that maximize the user's utility. In this study, we propose new approaches which, in conjunction with any existing recommendation technique, can improve the top-N item selection by taking into account rating variance. We empirically demonstrate how these approaches work with several recommendation techniques, increasing the accuracy of recommendations. We also show how these approaches can generate more personalized recommendations, as measured by the diversity metric. As a result, users can be given a better control to choose whether to receive recommendations with higher accuracy or higher diversity.

#! Typical collaborative filtering recommenders (CF) do not provide any chance for users to choose or evaluate the bases for recommendation. Once the system evaluates a group of users as being similar to a target user, her information is tailored by unknown people's taste. As a cultural event recommender, PITTCULT provides a way for users to rate the trustworthiness of other users; then, according to those ratings, a recommendation is generated. This paper explains why trust-based recommendation is necessary, and how studies using PITTCULT cope with the problems of the existing CF.

#! Internet users often face the challenge of identifying the most suitable product out of some product assortment available on a certain e-sales platform. Recommender systems can substantially alleviate this typically complex task. Since the rise of such systems a lot of effort has been done in developing different recommendation approaches and algorithms, which all of them have certain strengths and weaknesses. What has been widely ignored by the recommender community so far are the potentials and impacts of psychological and decision theoretical phenomenons, which already have been investigated and applied in the field of marketing. Such phenomenons promise big capability to support users in decision making when facing a comparison situation. This paper concentrates on two classes of phenomenons, which are decoy effects and serial position effects. Tightly coupled to these phenomenons is the problem of getting the utility function of a recommender right, as this function serves both as the basis of result set calculation as well as the fundament of exploitation of above mentioned phenomenons. Putting all these aspects together an extended architecture for recommender systems will be proposed in the end of the paper.

#! 2009 is likely to become the "Year of the Netflix Challenge" in recommender systems. With a prize of one million dollars one of the highest in computer science, it raised a tremendous awareness for as well as a transformation to the field of recommender systems. We are very happy to welcome you to the Third ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (ACM RecSys 2009) in New York. In the last few years, ACM RecSys has continuously grown and meanwhile certainly can be understood as the scientific core event in the area of recommender systems, bringing together persons from academic research, industry research as well as from applications. While recommender systems has close relations to many neighboring fields such as machine learning, information retrieval, databases, human computer interaction, e-commerce, semantic web and many others and many of the best conferences in these areas have their dedicated sessions on recommender systems, ACM RecSys is the conference where all of them finally meet. With 187 submissions this year's ACM RecSys has continued to grow at a fast rate of over 50%. Authors from 35 different countries from all over the world submitted their papers. After the program committee consisting of 78 researchers finished a thorough scientific review process in two rounds writing almost 700 reviews, less than 19% of the long submissions have been accepted, the overall acceptance rate for long and short papers is less than 40%. Besides a deepened interest in algorithms for recommender systems, this year tags and social networks, privacy and security and trust attracted the most attention by authors. Moreover, the program of ACM RecSys 2009 includes two keynotes, one from a more academic perspective and another one from a more industrial perspective, a panel session about the recently concluded Netflix challenge, three tutorials and three workshops as well as a doctoral symposium.

#! A fundamental aspect of rating-based recommender systems is the observation process, the process by which users choose the items they rate. Nearly all research on collaborative filtering and recommender systems is founded on the assumption that missing ratings are missing at random. The statistical theory of missing data shows that incorrect assumptions about missing data can lead to biased parameter estimation and prediction. In a recent study, we demonstrated strong evidence for violations of the missing at random condition in a real recommender system. In this paper we present the first study of the effect of non-random missing data on collaborative ranking, and extend our previous results regarding the impact of non-random missing data on collaborative prediction.

#! In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal model for collaborative filtering applications. Our model is based on low-rank matrix factorization that uses a spatio-temporal filtering approach to estimate user and item factors. The spatial component regularizes the factors by exploiting correlation across users and/or items, modeled as a function of some implicit feedback (e.g., who rated what) and/or some side information (e.g., user demographics, browsing history). In particular, we incorporate correlation in factors through a Markov random field prior in a probabilistic framework, whereby the neighborhood weights are functions of user and item covariates. The temporal component ensures that the user/item factors adapt to process changes that occur through time and is implemented in a state space framework with fast estimation through Kalman filtering. Our spatio-temporal filtering (ST-KF hereafter) approach provides a single joint model to simultaneously incorporate both spatial and temporal structure in ratings and therefore provides an accurate method to predict future ratings. To ensure scalability of ST-KF, we employ a mean-field approximation for inference. Incorporating user/item covariates in estimating neighborhood weights also helps in dealing with both cold-start and warm-start problems seamlessly in a single unified modeling framework; covariates predict factors for new users and items through the neighborhood. We illustrate our method on simulated data, benchmark data and data obtained from a relatively new recommender system application arising in the context of Yahoo! Front Page.

#! Recommender systems are widely used in online e-commerce applications to improve user engagement and then to increase revenue. A key challenge for recommender systems is providing high quality recommendation to users in ``cold-start" situations. We consider three types of cold-start problems: 1) recommendation on existing items for new users; 2) recommendation on new items for existing users; 3) recommendation on new items for new users. We propose predictive feature-based regression models that leverage all available information of users and items, such as user demographic information and item content features, to tackle cold-start problems. The resulting algorithms scale efficiently as a linear function of the number of observations. We verify the usefulness of our approach in three cold-start settings on the MovieLens and EachMovie datasets, by comparing with five alternatives including random, most popular, segmented most popular, and two variations of Vibes affinity algorithm widely used at Yahoo! for recommendation.

#! Different buyers exhibit different purchasing behaviors. Some rush to purchase new products while others tend to be more cautious, waiting for reviews from people they trust. In market analysis, the former group of buyers is often referred to as innovators and early adopters while the latter group is referred to as laggards. The adoption behavior is a dynamic feature of the user and varies over groups of products, e.g., innovators of literature may not be the innovators of electronics. The adoption order of users is a dynamic feature of the product, which can help to predict the future potential buyers. However, such dynamic features are usually unavailable in the description of products. In this paper, we study the user behavior of an online review website- Epinions.com. We first propose to model user adoption behaviors by creating a total ordering among users who rate the products in a given category. We develop a greedy algorithm and a Markov-chain based algorithm for computing the category total ordering. Next, we show that by using user behavior information, we can more accurately predict the category of a new product as well as predict which users will follow. Furthermore, by using the Epinion.com trust network as evidence, we demonstrate that our total ordering can group users into communities that closely resemble the trust network. Thus the adoption order can be a useful feature in recommendation systems.

#! Previous work on using external aggregate rating information showed that this information can be incorporated in several different types of recommender systems and improves their performance. In this paper, we propose a more general class of methods that combine external aggregate information with individual ratings in a novel way. Unlike the previously proposed methods, one of the defining features of this approach is that it takes into the consideration not only the aggregate average ratings but also the variance of the aggregate distribution of ratings. The methods proposed in this paper estimate unknown ratings by finding an optimal linear combination of individual-level and aggregate-level rating estimators in a form of a hierarchical regression (HR) model that is grounded in the theory of statistics and machine learning. The proposed HR model is general enough so that the standard individual-level recommender systems and naive aggregate methods constitute special cases of this model. We show that for the general HR model, the presence of the aggregate variance, surprisingly, does not significantly improve estimation of unknown ratings vis-a-vis the case when only aggregate average ratings are considered. In the paper, we experimentally show that the optimal linear combination approach significantly dominates all other special cases, including the classical non-aggregated case and our previously studied aggregate methods, and therefore is the method of choice.

#! Collaborative tagging applications have become a popular tool allowing Internet users to manage online resources with tags. Most collaborative tagging applications permit unsupervised tagging resulting in tag ambiguity in which a single tag has many different meanings and tag redundancy in which several tags have the same meaning. Common metrics for evaluating tag recommenders may overestimate the utility of ambiguous tags or ignore the appropriateness of redundant tags. Ambiguity and redundancy may even burden the user with additional effort by requiring them to clarify an annotation or forcing them to distinguish between highly related items. In this paper we demonstrate that ambiguity and redundancy impede the evaluation and performance of tag recommenders. Five tag recommendation strategies based on popularity, collaborative filtering and link analysis are explored. We use a cluster-based approach to define ambiguity and redundancy and provide extensive evaluation on three real world datasets.

#! We study personalized recommendation of social software items, including bookmarked web-pages, blog entries, and communities. We focus on recommendations that are derived from the user's social network. Social network information is collected and aggregated across different data sources within our organization. At the core of our research is a comparison between recommendations that are based on the user's familiarity network and his/her similarity network. We also examine the effect of adding explanations to each recommended item that show related people and their relationship to the user and to the item. Evaluation, based on an extensive user survey with 290 participants and a field study including 90 users, indicates superiority of the familiarity network as a basis for recommendations. In addition, an important instant effect of explanations is found - interest rate in recommended items increases when explanations are provided.

#! Tagging systems have become major infrastructures on the Web. They allow users to create tags that annotate and categorize content and share them with other users, very helpful in particular for searching multimedia content. However, as tagging is not constrained by a controlled vocabulary and annotation guidelines, tags tend to be noisy and sparse. Especially new resources annotated by only a few users have often rather idiosyncratic tags that do not reflect a common perspective useful for search. In this paper we introduce an approach based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for recommending tags of resources in order to improve search. Resources annotated by many users and thus equipped with a fairly stable and complete tag set are used to elicit latent topics to which new resources with only a few tags are mapped. Based on this, other tags belonging to a topic can be recommended for the new resource. Our evaluation shows that the approach achieves significantly better precision and recall than the use of association rules, suggested in previous work, and also recommends more specific tags. Moreover, extending resources with these recommended tags significantly improves search for new resources.

#! Besides the rating information, an increasing number of modern recommender systems also allow the users to add personalized tags to the items. Such tagging information may provide very useful information for item recommendation, because the users' interests in items can be implicitly reflected by the tags that they often use. Although some content-based recommender systems have made preliminary attempts recently to utilize tagging information to improve the recommendation performance, few recommender systems based on collaborative filtering (CF) have employed tagging information to help the item recommendation procedure. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called tag informed collaborative filtering (TagiCoFi), to seamlessly integrate tagging information into the CF procedure. Experimental results demonstrate that TagiCoFi outperforms its counterpart which discards the tagging information even when it is available, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

#! The recommendation of queries, known as query suggestion, is a common practice on major Web Search Engines. It aims to help users to find the information they are looking for, and is usually based on the knowledge learned from past interactions with the search engine. In this paper we propose a new model for query suggestion, the Search Shortcut Problem, that consists in recommending "successful" queries that allowed other users to satisfy, in the past, similar information needs. This new model has several advantages with respect to traditional query suggestion approaches. First, it allows a straightforward evaluation of algorithms from available query log data. Moreover, it simplifies the application of several recommendation techniques from other domains. Particularly, in this work we applied Collaborative Filtering to this problem, and evaluated the interesting results achieved on large query logs from AOL and Microsoft. Different techniques for analyzing and extracting information from query logs, as well as new metrics and techniques for measuring the effectiveness of recommendations are proposed and evaluated. The results obtained clearly show the importance of several of our contributions, and open an interesting field for future research.

#! Social network sites rely on the contributions of their members to create a lively and enjoyable space. Recent research has focused on using personalization and recommender technologies to encourage participation of existing members. In this work we present an early-intervention approach to encouraging participation and engagement, which makes recommendations to new users during their sign-up process. Our recommender system exploits external social media to produce people and profile entry recommendations for new users. We present results of a live user study, showing that users who received recommendations at sign-up created more social connections, contributed more content, and were on the whole more engaged with the system, contributing more without prompt and returning more often. We further show that recommendations for multiple content types yield significantly better results, in terms of user contribution and consumption; and that recommendations of more active users yield a higher return rate.

#! The Netflix Prize (NP) competition gave much attention to collaborative filtering (CF) approaches. Matrix factorization (MF) based CF approaches assign low dimensional feature vectors to users and items. We link CF and content-based filtering (CBF) by finding a linear transformation that transforms user or item descriptions so that they are as close as possible to the feature vectors generated by MF for CF. We propose methods for explicit feedback that are able to handle 140,000 features when feature vectors are very sparse. With movie metadata collected for the NP movies we show that the prediction performance of the methods is comparable to that of CF, and can be used to predict user preferences on new movies. We also investigate the value of movie metadata compared to movie ratings in regards of predictive power. We compare our solely CBF approach with a simple baseline rating-based predictor. We show that even 10 ratings of a new movie are more valuable than its metadata for predicting user ratings.

#! Current conversational recommender systems are unable to offer guarantees on the quality of their recommendations due to a lack of principled user utility models. We develop an approach to recommender systems that incorporates an explicit utility model into the recommendation process in a decision-theoretically sound fashion. The system maintains explicit constraints on user utility based on preferences revealed by the user's actions. We investigate a new decision criterion, setwise minimax regret (SMR), for constructing optimal recommendation sets: we develop algorithms for computing SMR, and prove that SMR determines choice sets for queries that are myopically optimal. This provides a natural basis for generating compound critiques in conversational recommender systems. Our simulation results suggest that this utility-theoretically sound approach to user modeling allows much more effective navigation of a product space than traditional approaches based on, for example, heuristic utility models and product similarity measures.

#! In this paper, we apply stacking, an ensemble learning method, to the problem of building hybrid recommendation systems. We also introduce the novel idea of using runtime metrics which represent properties of the input users/items as additional meta-features, allowing us to combine component recommendation engines at runtime based on user/item characteristics. In our system, component engines are level-1 predictors, and a level-2 predictor is learned to generate the final prediction of the hybrid system. The input features of the level-2 predictor are predictions from component engines and the runtime metrics. Experimental results show that our system outperforms each single component engine as well as a static hybrid system. Our method has the additional advantage of removing restrictions on component engines that can be employed; any engine applicable to the target recommendation task can be easily plugged into the system.

#! Content-based recommendation systems can provide recommendations for "cold-start" items for which little or no training data is available, but typically have lower accuracy than collaborative filtering systems. Conversely, collaborative filtering techniques often provide accurate recommendations, but fail on cold start items. Hybrid schemes attempt to combine these different kinds of information to yield better recommendations across the board. We describe unified Boltzmann machines, which are probabilistic models that combine collaborative and content information in a coherent manner. They encode collaborative and content information as features, and then learn weights that reflect how well each feature predicts user actions. In doing so, information of different types is automatically weighted, without the need for careful engineering of features or for post-hoc hybridization of distinct recommender systems. We present empirical results in the movie and shopping domains showing that unified Boltzmann machines can be used to combine content and collaborative information to yield results that are competitive with collaborative techniques in recommending items that have been seen before, and also effective at recommending cold-start items.

#! An approach to user-based collaborative filtering is proposed that refines prediction of item ratings that is based on global user similarity by incorporating information derived from a more detailed user comparison made on the basis of Rated Item Pools (RIPs). The preference spectrum defined by items that a user has rated, and ranging from best-liked to most disliked items, is divided into item sets, or RIPs, which supply the basis for a fine-grained calculation of similarity between users. The RIP-based approach makes it possible for the model to take advantage of user tastes that are matched at one end of the spectrum, e.g., two users agree on favorites, without requiring complete correspondence of item ratings between user profiles. The approach improves rating prediction, as compared to a baseline that uses the global user similarity alone. It does not unduly inflate computational complexity or rely on external resources, common shortcomings of competing rating prediction methods. Cases in which the nearest neighbors are relatively dissimilar, known to be challenging for user-based collaborative filtering, demonstrate particularly substantial improvement. Performance is shown to be stable across the choice of neighborhood size, number of pools and relative pool size.

#! Conversation double pivots recommend target items related to a source item, based on co-mentions of source and target items in online forums. We deployed several variants on the drupal.org site that supports the Drupal open source community, and assessed them through clickthrough rates. A similarity metric based on correlation of mentions rather than mere co-occurrence reduced the problem of over-recommending the most popular modules, but additional corrections for recency and uniqueness of mentions were not helpful. Detection of more module mentions in conversations dramatically improved the quality of recommendations, even though the detection algorithm then had more false positives. Recommendations based on conversation co-mention were more effective than those based on co-installation, because co-installation data only led to recommendations of complementary modules and not substitutes. Recommendations based on co-mention were more effective than those based on text similarity matching for navigating from the most popular modules, but less effective than text matching for less popular modules.

#! Robustness analysis research has shown that conventional memory-based recommender systems are very susceptible to malicious profile-injection attacks. A number of attack models have been proposed and studied and recent work has suggested that model-based collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms have greater robustness against these attacks. Moreover, to combat such attacks, several attack detection algorithms have been proposed. One that has shown high detection accuracy is based on using principal component analysis (PCA) to cluster attack profiles on the basis that such profiles are highly correlated. In this paper, we argue that the robustness observed in model-based algorithms is due to the fact that the proposed attacks have not targeted the specific vulnerabilities of these algorithms. We discuss how an effective attack targeting model-based algorithms that employ profile clustering can be designed. It transpires that the attack profiles employed in this attack, exhibit low rather than high pair-wise similarities and can easily be obfuscated to avoid PCA-based detection, while remaining effective.

#! It has been shown in recent years that effective profile injection or shilling attacks can be mounted on standard recommendation algorithms. These attacks consist of the insertion of bogus user profiles into the system database in order to manipulate the recommendation output, for example to promote or demote the predicted ratings for a particular product. A number of attack models have been proposed and some detection strategies to identify these attacks have been empirically evaluated. In this paper we show that the standard attack models can be readily detected using statistical detection techniques. We argue that insufficient consideration of the effectiveness of attacks under a constraint of statistical invariance has been taken in past research. In fact, it is possible to create effective attacks that are undetectable using the detection strategies proposed to date, including the PCA-based clustering strategy which has shown excellent performance against standard attacks. Nevertheless, these more advanced attacks can also be detected with careful design of a statistical detector. The question posed for future research is whether attack models that produce effective attack profiles that are statistically identical to genuine profiles are really possible.

#! In recommender systems, usually, a central server needs to have access to users' profiles in order to generate useful recommendations. Having this access, however, undermines the users' privacy. The more information is revealed to the server on the user-item relations, the lower the users' privacy is. Yet, hiding part of the profiles to increase the privacy comes at the cost of recommendation accuracy or difficulty of implementing the method. In this paper, we propose a distributed mechanism for users to augment their profiles in a way that obfuscates the user-item connection to an untrusted server, with minimum loss on the accuracy of the recommender system. We rely on the central server to generate the recommendations. However, each user stores his profile offline, modifies it by partly merging it with the profile of similar users through direct contact with them, and only then periodically uploads his profile to the server. We propose a metric to measure privacy at the system level, using graph matching concepts. Applying our method to the Netflix prize dataset, we show the effectiveness of the algorithm in solving the tradeoff between privacy and accuracy in recommender systems in an applicable way.

#! A collaborative filtering system recommends to users products that similar users like. Collaborative filtering systems influence purchase decisions, and hence have become targets of manipulation by unscrupulous vendors. We provide theoretical and empirical results demonstrating that while common nearest neighbor algorithms, which are widely used in commercial systems, can be highly susceptible to manipulation, a class of collaborative filtering algorithms which we refer to as linear is relatively robust. These results provide guidance for the design of future collaborative filtering systems.

#! A common approach to designing Recommender Systems (RS) consists of asking users to explicitly rate items in order to collect feedback about their preferences. However, users have been shown to be inconsistent and to introduce a non-negligible amount of natural noise in their ratings that affects the accuracy of the predictions. In this paper, we present a novel approach to improve RS accuracy by reducing the natural noise in the input data via a preprocessing step. In order to quantitatively understand the impact of natural noise, we first analyze the response of common recommendation algorithms to this noise. Next, we propose a novel algorithm to denoise existing datasets by means of re-rating: i.e. by asking users to rate previously rated items again. This denoising step yields very significant accuracy improvements. However, re-rating all items in the original dataset is unpractical. Therefore, we study the accuracy gains obtained when re-rating only some of the ratings.In particular, we propose two partial denoising strategies: data and user-dependent denoising. Finally, we compare the value of adding a rating of an unseen item vs. re-rating an item. We conclude with a proposal for RS to improve the quality of their user data and hence their accuracy: asking users to re-rate items might, in some circumstances, be more beneficial than asking users to rate unseen items.

#! Top-N item recommendation is one of the important tasks of recommenders. Collaborative filtering is the most popular approach to building recommender systems which can predict ratings for a given user and item. Collaborative filtering can be extended for top-N recommendation, but this approach does not work accurately for cold start users that have rated only a very small number of items. In this paper we propose novel methods exploiting a trust network to improve the quality of top-N recommendation. The first method performs a random walk on the trust network, considering the similarity of users in its termination condition. The second method combines the collaborative filtering and trust-based approach. Our experimental evaluation on the Epinions dataset demonstrates that approaches using a trust network clearly outperform the collaborative filtering approach in terms of recall, in particular for cold start users.

#! With the exponential growth of Web contents, Recommender System has become indispensable for discovering new information that might interest Web users. Despite their success in the industry, traditional recommender systems suffer from several problems. First, the sparseness of the user-item matrix seriously affects the recommendation quality. Second, traditional recommender systems ignore the connections among users, which loses the opportunity to provide more accurate and personalized recommendations. In this paper, aiming at providing more realistic and accurate recommendations, we propose a factor analysis-based optimization framework to incorporate the user trust and distrust relationships into the recommender systems. The contributions of this paper are three-fold: (1) We elaborate how user distrust information can benefit the recommender systems. (2) In terms of the trust relations, distinct from previous trust-aware recommender systems which are based on some heuristics, we systematically interpret how to constrain the objective function with trust regularization. (3) The experimental results show that the distrust relations among users are as important as the trust relations. The complexity analysis shows our method scales linearly with the number of observations, while the empirical analysis on a large Epinions dataset proves that our approaches perform better than the state-of-the-art approaches.

#! We propose a novel trust metric for social networks which is suitable for application to recommender systems. It is personalised and dynamic, and allows to compute the indirect trust between two agents which are not neighbours based on the direct trust between agents that are neighbours. In analogy to some personalised versions of PageRank, this metric makes use of the concept of feedback centrality and overcomes some of the limitations of other trust metrics. In particular, it does not neglect cycles and other patterns characterising social networks, as some other algorithms do. In order to apply the metric to recommender systems, we propose a way to make trust dynamic over time. We show by means of analytical approximations and computer simulations that the metric has the desired properties. Finally, we carry out an empirical validation on a dataset crawled from an Internet community and compare the performance of a recommender system using our metric to one using collaborative filtering.

The study was conducted in the context of a large-scale, commercial Mobile Internet platform, from which end users can download games to their mobile phones. Item recommendations were presented to platform visitors in different navigational situations; the recommendation lists were either determined with the help of different recommendation algorithms or based on nonpersonalized ranking techniques. The study is based on a sample of more than 155,000 different customers who visited the portal during a four week evaluation period. The analysis revealed that the use of personalized recommendations instead of non-personalized ones leads to a significant increase in viewed and sold items in different navigational situations and to an overall sales increase.

#! Recommender systems aim to substantially reduce information overload by suggesting lists of similar items that users may find interesting.Caching has been a useful technique for reducing stress on limited resources and improving response time. In this paper, we propose an 'active caching' technique for recommender systems based on a partial order approach that not only benefits from popularity and temporal locality, but also exploits spatial locality. This approach allows the processing of answers to neighboring non-cached queries in addition to the reporting of cached query results. Test results for several data sets and recommendation techniques show substantial improvement in the cache hit ratio and computational costs, while achieving reasonable recall rates.

#! Recommender systems can be used in online forums to recommend discussion topics to users; however as these forums are characterized by a constant influx of new users and new posts, it is important to consider the performance of the recommender system under a scenario in which the internal composition of the items to be recommended, i.e., discussion threads, and the user preferences are constantly changing. In this paper we describe and evaluate a forum recommender designed to handle the challenges of dynamically evolving internet forums used to gather and discuss feature requests for various software products. In particular, we empirically show that two proposed enhancements to the representations of user profiles will result in improved recommendation effectiveness in dynamic environments.

In the described approach, such recommendations are exemplified in an advertising scenario. We propose a distributed system architecture that uses semantic knowledge, based on terminologically enriched domain ontologies, to learn ontological user profiles and consequently infer recommendations through fuzzy semantic reasoning. A real world user study demonstrates the improvements attained in providing user-relevant recommendations with the aid of semantic profiles.

#! To understand users' acceptance of the emerging trend of personality-based recommenders (PBR), we evaluated an existing PBR using the technology acceptance model (TAM). We also compare it with a baseline rating-based recommender in a within-subject user study. Our results show that while the personality-based recommender is perceived to be only slightly more accurate than the rating-based one, it is much easier to use. The side-by-side comparison also reveals that users significantly favor the personality-based recommender and have a significantly higher intention to use such a system again. Therefore, we believe that if users accepted rating-based recommenders, they are most likely to accept personality-based recommenders and personality-based recommenders have a high likelihood to be widely adopted despite the fact that rating-based recommenders are now the industry norm. We further point out some preliminary guidelines on how to design personality-based recommender systems.

An experiment shows the adaptive element's higher potential to improve recommendation efficiency, relative to methods without this feature.

We maintain a distinct reputation system for each individual and we rely on users to identify appropriate correlations and rate the items using a system-provided recommendation language. The key idea is to design an incentive structure and a ranking system such that any inaccuracy in the recommendations implies the existence of a profitable arbitrage opportunity, hence making the system resistant to malicious spam and presentation bias. We also show that, under mild assumptions, our architecture provides users with incentive to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the ratings and the actual item qualities, quickly driving the system to an equilibrium state with accurate recommendations.

The evaluation has been performed on the pay-per-view datasets collected by two IP-television providers over a period of several months. The analysis shows that item-based algorithms perform better with respect to SVD-based ones in the early stage of the cold-start problem. Moreover, the accuracy of SVD-based algorithms, when using few latent factors, decreases with the time-evolution of the dataset. On the contrary, the same algorithms used with a large-enough number of latent features increase their accuracy with time and may outperform the item-based algorithms.

#! Collaborative tagging systems pose new challenges to the developers of recommender systems. As observed by recent research, traditional implementations of classic recommender approaches, such as collaborative filtering, are not working well in this new context. To address these challenges, a number of research groups worldwide work on adapting these approaches to the specific nature of collaborative tagging systems. In joining this stream of research, we have developed and compared three variants of user-based collaborative filtering algorithms to provide recommendations of articles on CiteULike. The first approach, Classic Collaborative filtering (CCF) uses Pearson correlation to calculate similarity between users and a classic adjusted ratings formula to rank the recommendations. The second approach, Neighbor-weighted Collaborative Filtering, takes into account the number of raters in the ranking formula of the recommendations. The third approach explores an innovative way to form the user neighborhood based on a modified version of the Okapi BM25 model over users' tags. Our results suggest that both alterations of CCF are beneficial. Incorporating the number of raters into the algorithms leads to an improvement of precision, while tag-based BM25 can be considered as an alternative to Pearson correlation to calculate the similarity between users and their neighbors.

#! Short search engine queries do not provide contextual information, making it difficult for traditional search engines to understand what users are really requesting. One approach to this problem is to use recommender systems that identify user interests through various methods in order to provide information specific to the user's needs. However, many current recommender systems use a collaborative model based on a network of users to provide the recommendations, leading to problems in environments where network relationships are sparse or unknown. Content-based recommenders can avoid the sparsity problem but they may be inefficient for large document collections. In this paper, we propose a concept-based recommender system that recommends papers to general users of the CiteSeerx digital library of Computer Science research publications. We also represent a novel way of classifying documents and creating user profiles based on the ACM (Association for Computer Machinery) classification tree. Based on these user profiles which are built using past click histories, relevant papers in the domain are recommended to users. Experiments with a set of users on the CiteSeerX database show that our concept-based method provides accurate recommendations even with limited user profile histories.

#! Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommendations are computed by leveraging a historical data set of users' ratings for items. It assumes that the users' previously recorded ratings can help in predicting future ratings. This has been validated extensively, but in some domains item ratings can be influenced by contextual conditions, such as the time or the goal of the item consumption. This type of information is not exploited by standard CF models. This paper introduces and analyzes a novel pre-filtering technique for context-aware CF called item splitting. In this approach, the ratings of certain items are split, according to the value of an item-dependent contextual condition. Each split item generates two fictitious items that are used in the prediction algorithm instead of the original one. We evaluated this approach on real world and semi-synthetic data sets using matrix-factorization and nearest neighbor CF algorithms. We show that item splitting can be beneficial and its performance depends on the item selection method and on the influence of the contextual variables on the item ratings.

#! Critiquing-based recommenders do not require users to state all of their preferences upfront or rate a set of previously experienced products. Compared to other types of recommenders, they require relatively little user effort, especially initially, despite potential accuracy problems. On the other hand, they rely on a set of critiques to elicit users feedback in order to improve accuracy. Thus the better the critiques are, the more accurately and efficiently the system becomes in generating its recommendations. This method has been successfully applied to high-involvement products. However, it was never tested on public taste products such as music, films, perfumes, fashion goods or wine. Indeed our initial trial adapting traditional critiquing methods to this new domain led to unsatisfactory results. This has motivated us to develop a novel approach named "editorial picked critiques" (EPC) that accounts for users' needs for popularity information, editorial suggestions, as well as their needs for personalization and diversity. Through an empirical study, we demonstrate that EPC presents a viable recommender approach and is superior on several dimensions to critiques generated by data mining methods.

#! In this paper we present Donation Dashboard, a system that recommends non-profit organizations to users in the form of a portfolio of donation amounts. Recommendations are made using our Eigentaste 2.0 constant-time collaborative filtering algorithm in combination with a new method for generating a weighted portfolio of recommendations. The key challenge is to generate a customized portfolio that does not necessarily exclude items already rated by the user. Under our method, the weights for items in the portfolio that have not yet been rated by the user are normalized factors of their predicted ratings, and the weights for items previously rated by the user are normalized factors of the actual ratings. Donation Dashboard 1.0 launched in April 2008, and as of May 8 2009 we have collected over 59,000 ratings of 70 nonprofit organizations from over 3,800 users. In this working paper we describe our experience developing Donation Dashboard, including the design of the system and our new method for portfolio generation. We use Normalized Mean Absolute Error (NMAE) to measure the accuracy of Eigentaste using our dataset of non-profit organization ratings and we compare that with the global mean algorithm. We analyze the data collected since the launch of the site, and we have made our dataset available to the public. Donation Dashboard and the Donation Dashboard dataset are accessible at: http://dd.berkeley.edu and http://dd.berkeley.edu/dataset

#! Recommender systems provide consumers with ratings of items. These ratings are based on a set of ratings that were obtained from a wide scope of users. Predicting the ratings can be formulated as a regression problem. Ensemble regression methods are effective tools that improve the results of simple regression algorithms by iteratively applying the simple algorithm to a diverse set of inputs. The present paper describes a simple and effective ensemble regressor for the prediction of missing ratings in recommender systems. The ensemble method is an adaptation of the AdaBoost regression algorithm for recommendation tasks. In all iterations, interpolation weights for all nearest neighbors are simultaneously derived by minimizing the root mean squared error. From iteration to iteration instances that are hard to predict are reinforced by manipulating their weights in the goal function that needs to be minimized. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that the ensemble methodology significantly improves the predictive performance of single neighborhood-based collaborative filtering.

Although some of these methods have been studied independently, no prior research compared the performance of these methods to determine which of them is better than the others. This paper focuses on comparing the pre-filtering and the post-filtering approaches and identifying which method dominates the other and under which circumstances. Since there are no clear winners in this comparison, we propose an alternative more effective method of selecting the winners in the pre- vs. the post-filtering comparison. This strategy provides analysts and companies with a practical suggestion on how to pick a good pre- or post-filtering approach in an effective manner to improve performance of a context-aware recommender system.

#! With the advent of online social networks, the trust-based approach to recommendation has emerged which exploits the trust network among users and makes recommendations based on the ratings of trusted users in the network. In this paper, we introduce a two dimensional trust model which dynamically gets updated based on users's feedbacks, in contrast to static trust values in current trust models. Explorability measures the extent to which a user can rely on recommendations returned by the social network of a trusted user. Dependability represents the extent to which a user's own ratings can be trusted by users trusting him directly and indirectly. We propose a method to learn the values of explorability and dependability from raw trust data and feedback expressed by users on the recommendations they receive. Positive feedback will increase the trust and negative feedback will decrease the trust among users. We performed an evaluation on the Epinions dataset, demonstrating that exploiting user feedback results in lower prediction error compared to existing trust-based and collaborative filtering approaches.

The proposed formalization relies on item regions and attempts to identify regions that are under-exposed to the user.

We evaluate this approach on the MovieLens data set and compare our otb recommendations against conventional recommendation strategies.

We calculate sum of Bayesian ratings (SBR) of all lists containing an item pair as the strength of item-item associations in that pair. SBR takes into consideration not only the number of lists the items have co-appeared in, but also the quality of the lists.

#! A crucial operation in memory-based collaborative filtering (CF) is determining nearest neighbors (NNs) of users/items. This paper addresses two phenomena that emerge when CF algorithms perform NN search in high-dimensional spaces that are typical in CF applications. The first is similarity concentration and the second is the appearance of hubs (i.e. points which appear in $k$-NN lists of many other points). Through theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation we show that these phenomena are inherent properties of high-dimensional space, unrelated to other data properties like sparsity, and that they can impact CF algorithms by questioning the meaning and representativeness of discovered NNs. Moreover, we show that it is not easy to mitigate the phenomena using dimensionality reduction. Studying these phenomena aims to provide a better understanding of the limitations of memory-based CF and motivate the development of new algorithms that would overcome them.

#! We present iTag, a personalized tag recommendation system for blogs. iTag improves on current tag recommendation systems in two ways. First, iTag has much higher precision and recall than previously proposed tagging algorithms. For example, iTag achieved over 60% precision and recall on a set of 1000 blog posts selected at random from a WordPress RSS feed in April 2009, whereas the previously developed TagAssist achieved less than 10% precision and recall on our data. Second, iTag performs just as well when trained on a single user's blog as when trained on a large corpus of blogs. Thus, iTag can be deployed as a global, non-personalized tag recommendation system, or as a personalized tag recommender. Our experiments and survey of tagging behavior suggest that bloggers use tags idiosyncratically, so personalized tagging is an important option.

#! Content-based recommender systems try to recommend items similar to those a given user has liked in the past. The basic process consists of matching up the attributes of a user profile, in which preferences and interests are stored, with the attributes of a content object (item). Common-sense and domain-specific knowledge may be useful to give some meaning to the content of items, thus helping to generate more informative features than "plain" attributes. The process of learning user profiles could also benefit from the infusion of exogenous knowledge or open source knowledge, with respect to the classical use of endogenous knowledge (extracted from the items themselves). The main contribution of this paper is a proposal for knowledge infusion into content-based recommender systems, which suggests a novel view of this type of systems, mostly oriented to content interpretation by way of the infused knowledge. The idea is to provide the system with the "linguistic" and "cultural" background knowledge that hopefully allows a more accurate content analysis than classic approaches based on words. A set of knowledge sources is modeled to create a memory of linguistic competencies and of more specific world "facts", that can be exploited to reason about content as well as to support the user profiling and recommendation processes. The modeled knowledge sources include a dictionary, Wikipedia, and content generated by users (i.e. tags provided on items), while the core of the reasoning component is a spreading activation algorithm.

In this paper, we describe a classification-based recommender system that is designed to recommend the most helpful reviews for a given product. We present a large-scale evaluation of our approach using TripAdvisor hotel reviews, and we show that our approach is capable of suggesting superior reviews compared to a number of alternative recommendation benchmarks.

#! Code recommender systems ease the use and learning of software frameworks and libraries by recommending calls based on already present code. Typically, code recommender tools have been based on rather simple rule based systems while many of the recent advances in Recommender Systems and Collaborative Filtering have been largely focused on rating data. While many of these advances can be incorporated in the code recommendation setting this problem also brings considerable challenges of its own. In this paper, we extend state-of-the-art collaborative filtering technology, namely Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization (MMMF) to this interesting application domain and show how to deal with the challenges posed by this problem. To this end, we introduce two new loss functions to the MMMF model. While we focus on code recommendation in this paper, our contributions and the methodology we propose can be of use in almost any collaborative setting that can be represented as a binary interaction matrix. We evaluate the algorithm on real data drawn from the Eclipse Open Source Project. The results show a significant improvement over current rule-based approaches.

Our hypothesis is that if a user was good at predicting the past ratings, then his/her predictions will be also helpful to recommend ratings in the future. The predictive capability of a user will be measured using two different criteria: The first one which is based on the likelihood of the active user's rating and the second one tries to minimize the error obtained using his/her predictions. We show our experimental results using standard data sets.

Some recommender systems (Amazon.com etc.) try to explain their recommendations, in an effort to regain customer acceptance and trust. But their explanations are poor, because they are based solely on rating data, ignoring the content data. Our prototype system MoviExplain is a movie recommender system that provides both accurate and justifiable recommendations.

#! To exploit the enormous potential of niche products, modern information systems must support users in exploring digital libraries and online catalogs. A straight-forward way of doing so is to support browsing the available items, which is in general realized by presenting a user the top-N recommendations for each item. However, recent research indicates that most of the niche products reside in the so-called Long Tail, and simple collaborative filtering-based recommender systems alone do not allow to explore these niche products. In this paper we show that it is not only a popularity problem related to the collaborative filtering approach that makes a portion of the elements of a digital library inaccessible via browsing, but also a consequence of the top N-recommendation approach itself.

#! This paper proposes a novel Collaborative Filtering scheme; it focuses on the dynamics and precedence of user preference to recommend items that match the latest preference of the target user. In predicting which items this user will purchase in the near future, the proposed algorithm identifies purchase history logs of users who have similar preferences and a high degree of purchase precedence (i.e., purchasing the same items earlier) relative to the target user. We call this metric the Personal Innovator Degree (PID). Experiments using real online sales data show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods.

#! We demonstrate how user ratings can be accurately predicted from a set of tags assigned to a book on a social-networking site. Since a newly-published book is unlikely to have social-tags already assigned to it, we describe a probabilistic model for inferring the most probable tags from the text of the book. We evaluate the proposed approach on a newly-created corpus, involving 146 books and 1060 users. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly better than a well-tuned collaborative filtering baseline for books with 10 or fewer ratings. We also show how predictions based on social-tags can be combined with the traditional collaborative-filtering methods to yield superior performance with any number of ratings.

#! We present a preference aggregation algorithm designed for situations in which a limited number of users each review a small subset of a large (but finite) set of candidates. This algorithm aggregates scores by using users' relative preferences to search for a Kemeny-optimal ordering of items, and then uses this ordering to identify good and bad items, as well as those that are the subject of reviewer conflict. The algorithm uses variable-neighborhood local search, allowing the efficient discovery of high-quality consensus orderings while remaining computationally feasible. It provides a significant increase in solution quality over existing systems. We discuss potential applications of this algorithm in group recommender systems for a variety of scenarios, including program committees and faculty searches.

#! Utility or preference elicitation is a critical component in many recommender and decision support systems. However, most frameworks for elicitation assume a predefined set of features (e.g., as derived from catalog descriptions) over which user preferences are expressed. Just as user preferences vary considerably, so too can the features over which they are most comfortable expressing these preferences. In this work, we consider preference elicitation in the presence of subjective or user-defined features. We treat the problem of learning a user's feature definition as one of concept learning, but whose goal is to learn only enough about the concept definition to enable a good decision to be made. This is complicated by the fact that user preferences are unknown. We describe computational procedures for identifying optimal alternatives w.r.t minimax regret in the presence of both utility and concept uncertainty; and develop several heuristic query strategies that focus on reduction of relevant concept and utility uncertainty. Computational experiments verify the efficacy of these strategies.

#! For users, recommendations can sometimes seem odd or counterintuitive. Visualizing recommendations can remove some of this mystery, showing how a recommendation is grouped with other choices. A drawing can also lead a user's eye to other options. Traditional 2D-embeddings of points can be used to create a basic layout, but these methods, by themselves, do not illustrate clusters and neighborhoods very well. In this paper, we propose the use of geographic maps to enhance the definition of clusters and neighborhoods, and consider the effectiveness of this approach in visualizing similarities and recommendations arising from TV shows.

#! Recommender systems based on user feedback rank items by aggregating users' ratings in order to select those that are ranked highest. Ratings are usually aggregated using a weighted arithmetic mean. However, the mean is quite sensitive to outliers and biases, and thus may not be the most informative aggregate. We compare the accuracy and robustness of three different aggregators: the mean, median and mode. The results show that the median may often be a better choice than the mean, and can significantly improve recommendation accuracy and robustness in collaborative filtering systems.

#! We present a recommender systems approach to conference paper assignment, i.e., the task of assigning paper submissions to reviewers. We address both the modeling of reviewer-paper preferences (which can be cast as a learning problem) and the optimization of reviewing assignments to satisfy global conference criteria (which can be viewed as constraint satisfaction). Due to the paucity of preference data per reviewer or per paper (relative to other recommender systems applications) we show how we can integrate multiple sources of information to learn reviewer-paper preference models. Our models are evaluated not just in terms of prediction accuracy but in terms of end-assignment quality. Using a linear programming-based assignment optimization, we show how our approach better explores the space of unsupplied assignments to maximize the overall affinities of papers assigned to reviewers. We demonstrate our results on real reviewer bidding data from the IEEE ICDM 2007 conference.

#! Online stores offer an increasingly large set of products. Interactive decision aids are becoming indispensable tools assisting users as they search for an ideal product to purchase. For an e-commerce website, adopting the correct tools can affect its survival: effective product recommender tools are increasingly recognized by online stores as effective means to sell more products; on the other hand, sites that do not employ intelligent tools will not only see poor purchase volumes but also experience less traffic because consumers are more likely to return to a site employing recommender systems. This paper presents ongoing research in understanding the impact of various decision aids on users' interaction behaviors and their subjective perceptions of these aids. In the current experiment, we employed an eye tracker in an in-depth user study to understand the influence of recommenders on how users select items for the basket set. We collected more than 20,300 fixation data points in 3,648 areas of interest. Our studies show that while users still rely on product filtering tools, the use of recommenders is becoming more prominent in helping them construct the basket set and is monotonically increasing as time goes on.

Besides other discussed arguments the resulting large size of innovator networks suggests that algorithmic approaches for team recommendation may be needed in that scenario. The current work identifies the related difficulties and thoroughly investigates aspects entities for the problem of team recommendation. Based on that, we develop a meta model which allows to instantiate and integrate most of the vast number of the existing socio-/psychological models on optimal team composition. This meta model is necessary for operationalizing our intended team recommendation approach.

However, most research focused on the evaluation and development of appropriate methods rather than tackling the practical challenges of how to integrate recommendation methods into real tagging systems, record and evaluate their performance. In this paper we describe the tag recommendation framework we developed for our social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy. With the intention to develop, test, and evaluate recommendation algorithms and supporting cooperation with researchers, we designed the framework to be easily extensible, open for a variety of methods, and usable independent from BibSonomy. Furthermore, this paper presents a first evaluation of two exemplarily deployed recommendation methods.

#! A functional dependency is a logical relationship amongst the attributes that define a table of data. Specifically, a functional dependency holds when the values of a subset of the attributes in a dataset determine the values of one or more other attributes. Uncovering such dependencies is utilized in many domains, such as database design. We demonstrate that it can also be utilized in a recommendation context when datasets represent product catalogues. State-of-the-art approaches to discovering functional dependencies require a tabular representation of the data. However, product catalogues can sometimes be defined implicitly, for example, as a set of solutions to a combinatorial problem. Such combinatorial catalogues can have a very large number of products, thus making standard approaches to uncovering functional dependencies inapplicable. In this paper we present the first approach to computing functional dependencies over compiled knowledge representations which can often be small even for huge catalogues. In particular, we develop efficient algorithms that operate over decision diagrams, which allow us to handle catalogues that are out of reach for current approaches. We apply our algorithms to tabular and combinatorial benchmarks and detect a number of properties that could be considered as anomalies in product catalogues.

#! In a recommender system that suggests options based on user attribute weights, the method of preference elicitation (PE) employed by a recommender system can influence users' satisfaction with the system, as well as the perceived usefulness and the understandability of the system. Specifically, we hypothesize that users with different levels of domain knowledge prefer different types of PE. While domain experts reported higher satisfaction and perceived usefulness with attribute-based PE (i.e., indicating preference levels for the domain-related attributes), novices preferred case-based PE (i.e., indicating the preference for specific examples, from which attribute-preferences can then be implicitly calculated). The paper discusses the decision-theoretical principles that are believed to lead to this distinction, as well as an experiment that provides substantial evidence for the hypothesis. Consequently, we introduce the idea of adapting the method of PE to users' domain knowledge on the fly using click stream data.

#! Different recommender systems based on collaborative technology have been proposed that recommend new relevant products to users by exploring past user preference patterns. The most common approach generates recommendations based on user consumption patterns and on rating information gathered during each user-item interaction. In this paper we introduce a novel approach based on views of items, which are basically more complex models of the user-item interactions aimed at capturing the aspects on which users base their ratings. The resulting view-based approach recommends views to users instead of the traditional items. The proposed algorithms are tested on an artificial database, and the results show that modeling further interaction information improves the accuracy of predictions, provides a robust background to explain recommendations, exposes users to more specific recommendations and leads to better models of user preferences.

#! This extended abstract presents a new spatial model for collaboratively recommending "compelling" comments in an online discussion forum that promote consensus among a diverse group of users. In this application our goal is to promote comments that are rated highly by dissimilar users, which in some sense is a dual to traditional recommender problems. We propose a model for weighting and aggregating comment ratings that gives greater influence to positive ratings from users who tend to disagree with the commenter, and we compare it with various alternate methods. The model has the added benefit of being resistant to manipulation by false ratings and sybil attacks. We test the model on comments in Opinion Space, a new online discussion tool that allows users to visualize where they stand with respect to other users in terms of their opinions on a set of controversial propositions. Comments in the system are recommended visually, where more "compelling" comments are emphasized with larger sizes.

In particular, it is shown that given a personalized recommendation for points of interests (POIs), the user's selection of POIs can be influenced by enriching their presentation with music tracks that are matching the user's profile and also the POIs. This paper presents the results of an online, live-users, experiment where we evaluated alternative approaches for matching POIs and music, based on tagging and text matching.

#! Knowledge-based recommender systems are applications that support users in the process of retrieving items from a complex product assortment (e.g. computers, holiday packages, and financial services). Recommendations are determined on the basis of explicitly defined user requirements which can be interpreted as constraints to be fulfilled by the items stored in a product table. If no solution (item) can be found, existing knowledge-based recommenders propose non-personalized query relaxations and repair actions for the given set of customer requirements that support a recovery from the dead-end. This paper points out how the usability of knowledge-based recommender systems can be improved by introducing the concept of personalized query relaxations and repair actions.

#! We present a knowledge-intensive and model-based case-based reasoning framework that supports the truster for situation-aware trust management. The suggested method augments the typically sparse trust information by inferring the missing information from other situational conditions, and can better support situation-aware trust management. Our framework can be coupled with existing trust management models to make them situation-aware. It uses the underlying model of trust management to transfer trust information between situations. We validate the proposed framework for Subjective Logic trust management model and evaluate it by conducting experiments on a large real dataset.

#! Nowadays, people have been increasingly interested in exploiting Web Search Engines (WSEs) not only for having access to simple Web pages, but mainly for accomplishing even complex activities, namely Web-mediated processes (or taskflows). Thus, users' information needs will become more complex, and Web search and recommender systems should change accordingly for dealing with this shift. We claim that such taskflows and their composing tasks are implicitly present in users' minds when they interact with a WSE to access the Web. Our first research challenge is thus to evaluate this belief by analyzing a very large, long-term log of queries submitted to a WSE, and associating meaningful semantic labels with the extracted tasks (i.e., clusters of related queries) and taskflows. This large knowledge base constitutes a good starting point for building a model of users' behaviors. The second research challenge is to devise a novel recommender system that goes beyond the simple query suggestion of modern WSEs. Our system has to exploit the knowledge base of Web-mediated processes and the learned model of users' behaviors, to generate complex insights and task-based suggestions to incoming users while they interact with a WSE.

#! As the Web has shifted to an interactive environment where vast amounts of content is created by users, the question of whom to trust and what information to trust has become both more important and more difficult to answer. At the same time, social networks have become very popular with over a billion accounts shared across hundreds of networks. Social trust relationships, derived from social networks, are uniquely suited to speak to the quality of online information; recommender systems are designed to personalize, sort, aggregate, and highlight information. Merging social networks, trust, and recommender systems can improve the accuracy of recommendations and improve the user's experience. In this tutorial, we will cover the use of social trust in recommender systems. Topics including the computation of trust in social networks, integration of trust into recommender systems, and a discussion of when trust offers benefits and the challenges it presents.

#! We welcome you to the 4th ACM Recommender Systems Conference (ACM RecSys 2010), this time from beautiful and sunny Barcelona. After three fantastic preceding conferences, we took on the challenge of continuing on the success trend knowing that a city such as Barcelona would offer the ideal setting. Not only is Barcelona a top tourism destination but it has also a very bustling industry that includes large companies and young startups in recommender systems and related areas. RecSys is maturing as a research area and you will find several signs of that maturity reflected in these proceedings. One sign is becoming cumulative: performance of new algorithms is compared to previous algorithms and contrasts are made between performance on different datasets. With maturity, however, also comes a questioning of assumptions. For example, you will find papers that argue for different measures of success than prediction accuracy, such as stability and coverage. Despite maturity, the field also continues to be creative. You will find papers exploring new ways of collecting user preferences beyond like/dislike of individual items, such as pairwise orderings or allocation of points among a set of items. You will also find research identifying and exploiting the specific characteristics of non-standard item types to recommend, ranging from people to groups to recipes to research papers. For the first time, ACM RecSys 2010 had more than 200 submissions. Of 129 full paper submissions, 25 were accepted (19.4%) for oral presentation at the conference. Of 78 short paper submissions, 32 were accepted (41.0%) for poster presentation. In addition, we introduced a new track for submission of demos and case study reports, which will also be presented at the poster session. The program also includes three invited tutorials, by senior researchers Joe Konstan, Ricardo Baeza-Yates, and Guy Shani, and an invited keynote by Edouard Servan-Schreiber. The conference begins with an industry panel examining the future of recommender systems in several different industries, and how it relates to search. Panelists from Neo Metrics Barcelona, Bloomberg.com, YouTube, SAP, and Avail Intelligence will join industry chairs Ido Guy and Alex Jaimes on stage. Tuesday morning begins with a panel on contests and challenges. In addition to a skeptic's voice questioning the wisdom of contests overall, the panel will explore alternative tasks for contests besides prediction and ranking, such as making creative use of the outputs of a fixed recommender engine, or eliciting inputs for a recommender engine. In addition to the main program, we would also like to highlight the growing success of the collocated workshops. This year we have seven workshops distributed on two different days of the conference. These workshops include most of the new trending research lines in recommender systems. They focus on application areas of RecSys such as music, e-Learning, or the social web. Others analyze some cross-cutting concerns in research such as how to deal with contextual or heterogeneous information, or how to bring the user into the loop in the evaluation phase. Finally, one workshop specifically focuses on the practical concerns of deploying and evaluating recommender systems in real-world settings.

#! We present the design, implementation and evaluation of a new geotagging service, Gloe, that makes it easy to find, rate and recommend arbitrary on-line content in a mobile setting. The service automates the content search process by taking advantage of geographic and social context, while using crowdsourced expertise to present a personalized feed of targeted information ranked by a novel geo-aware rating and incentive mechanism. Users rate the relevance of recommendations for particular locations using a limited, global voting budget. This budget is, in turn, increased by accurately predicting local content popularity. One of the key goals of our mechanism is to encourage ratings, and in an evaluation of the live system we found that the rating to click ratio was 107 times higher than the ratio for videos on YouTube, 34 times higher than the ratio for applications on the Android Market, and 3 times higher than the ratio for Web pages on Digg. To investigate whether our mechanism also had qualitative effects on the ratings we conducted a number of experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk, with 500 users, comparing our mechanism to the de-facto 5-star ratings commonly in use on the Web. Our results show that budgets improved the ranking and incentives improved the aggregate rating of a series of location-dependent Web pages.

#! Collaborative filtering is a widely used technique for rating prediction in recommender systems. Memory based collaborative filtering algorithms assign weights to the users to capture similarities between them. The weighted average of similar users' ratings for the test item is output as prediction. We propose a memory based algorithm that is markedly different from the existing approaches. We use preference relations instead of absolute ratings for similarity calculations, as preference relations between items are generally more consistent than ratings across like-minded users. Each user's ratings are viewed as a preference graph. Similarity weights are learned using an iterative method motivated by online learning. These weights are used to create an aggregate preference graph. Ratings are inferred to maximally agree with this aggregate graph. The use of preference relations allows the rating of an item to be influenced by other items, which is not the case in the weighted-average approaches of the existing techniques. This is very effective when the data is sparse, specially for the items rated by few users. Our experiments show that the our method outperforms other methods in the sparse regions. However, for dense regions, sometimes our results are comparable to the competing approaches, and sometimes worse.

#! Recommender systems have emerged as an effective decision tool to help users more easily and quickly find products that they prefer, especially in e-commerce environments. However, few studies have tried to understand how this technology has influenced the way users search for products and make purchase decisions. Our current research aims at examining the impact of recommenders by understanding how recommendation tools integrate the classical economic schemes and how they modify product search patterns. We report our work in employing an eye tracking system and collecting users' interaction behaviors as they browsed and selected products to buy from an online product retail website offering over 3,500 items. This in-depth user study has enabled us to collect over 48,000 fixation data points and 7,720 areas of interest from eighteen users, each spending more than one hour on our site. Our study shows that while users still use traditional product search tools to examine alternatives, recommenders definitely provide users with new opportunities in their decision process. More specifically, users actively click and gaze at products recommended to them, up to 40% of the time. In addition, recommendation areas are highly attractive, drawing users to add 50% more items to their baskets as a traditional tool does. Observing that users consult the recommendation area more as they are close to the end of their search process, it seems that recommenders enhance users' decision confidence by satisfying their need for diversity. Based on these results, we derive several interaction design guidelines that can significantly improve users' satisfaction and perception of product recommenders.

#! Contests and challenges have energized researchers and focused attention in many fields recently, including recommender systems. At the 2008 RecSys conference, winners were announced for a contest proposing new startup companies. The 2009 conference featured a panel reflecting on the then recently completed Netflix challenge. Would additional contests help move the field of recommender systems forward? Or would they just draw attention from the most important problems to problems that are most easily formulated as contests? If contests would be useful, what should the tasks be and how should performance be evaluated? The panel will begin with short presentations by the panelists. Following that, the panelists will respond to brief sketches of possible new contests. In addition to prediction and ranking tasks, tasks might include making creative use of the outputs of a fixed recommender engine, or eliciting inputs for a recommender engine.

#! In many commercial systems, the 'best bet' recommendations are shown, but the predicted rating values are not. This is usually referred to as a top-N recommendation task, where the goal of the recommender system is to find a few specific items which are supposed to be most appealing to the user. Common methodologies based on error metrics (such as RMSE) are not a natural fit for evaluating the top-N recommendation task. Rather, top-N performance can be directly measured by alternative methodologies based on accuracy metrics (such as precision/recall). An extensive evaluation of several state-of-the art recommender algorithms suggests that algorithms optimized for minimizing RMSE do not necessarily perform as expected in terms of top-N recommendation task. Results show that improvements in RMSE often do not translate into accuracy improvements. In particular, a naive non-personalized algorithm can outperform some common recommendation approaches and almost match the accuracy of sophisticated algorithms. Another finding is that the very few top popular items can skew the top-N performance. The analysis points out that when evaluating a recommender algorithm on the top-N recommendation task, the test set should be chosen carefully in order to not bias accuracy metrics towards non-personalized solutions. Finally, we offer practitioners new variants of two collaborative filtering algorithms that, regardless of their RMSE, significantly outperform other recommender algorithms in pursuing the top-N recommendation task, with offering additional practical advantages. This comes at surprise given the simplicity of these two methods.

#! The paper introduces stability as a new measure of the recommender systems performance. In general, we define a recommendation algorithm to be "stable" if its predictions for the same items are consistent over a period of time, assuming that any new ratings that have been submitted to the recommender system over the same period of time are in complete agreement with system's prior predictions. In this paper, we advocate that stability should be a desired property of recommendation algorithms, because unstable recommendations can lead to user confusion and, therefore, reduce trust in recommender systems. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate stability of several popular recommendation algorithms. Our results suggest that model-based recommendation techniques demonstrate higher stability than memory-based collaborative filtering heuristics. We also find that the stability measure for recommendation techniques is influenced by many factors, including the sparsity of the initial rating data, the number of new incoming ratings (representing the length of the time period over which the stability is being measured), the distribution of the newly added rating values, and the rating normalization procedures employed by the recommendation algorithms.

#! This paper is about the utility of making personalized recommendations. While it is important to accurately predict the target user's preference, in practice the accuracy should not be the only concern; a useful recommender system needs to consider the user's utility or satisfaction of fulfilling a certain information seeking task. For example, recommending popular items (products) is unlikely to result in more gain than discovering insignificant ("long tail") yet liked items because the popular ones might be already known to the user. Equally, recommending items that are out of stock would be frustrating for both the user and system if the system is employed to discover items to purchase. Thus, it is important to have a flexible recommendation framework that takes into account additional recommendation goals meanwhile minimizing the performance loss in order to provide greater adjustability and a better user experience. To achieve this, in this paper, we propose a general recommendation optimization framework that not only considers the predicted preference scores (e.g. ratings) but also deals with additional operational or resource related recommendation goals. Using this framework we demonstrate through realistic examples how to expand existing rating prediction algorithms by biasing the recommendation depending on other external factors such as the availability, profitability or usefulness of an item. Our experiments on real data sets demonstrate that this framework is indeed able to cope with multiple objectives with minor performance loss.

#! Even though people are attracted by large, high quality recommendation sets, psychological research on choice overload shows that choosing an item from recommendation sets containing many attractive items can be a very difficult task. A web-based user experiment using a matrix factorization algorithm applied to the MovieLens dataset was used to investigate the effect of recommendation set size (5 or 20 items) and set quality (low or high) on perceived variety, recommendation set attractiveness, choice difficulty and satisfaction with the chosen item. The results show that larger sets containing only good items do not necessarily result in higher choice satisfaction compared to smaller sets, as the increased recommendation set attractiveness is counteracted by the increased difficulty of choosing from these sets. These findings were supported by behavioral measurements revealing intensified information search and increased acquisition times for these large attractive sets. Important implications of these findings for the design of recommender system user interfaces will be discussed.

#! Alternating least squares (ALS) is a powerful matrix factorization (MF) algorithm for both explicit and implicit feedback based recommender systems. As shown in many articles, increasing the number of latent factors (denoted by K) boosts the prediction accuracy of MF based recommender systems, including ALS as well. The price of the better accuracy is paid by the increased running time: the running time of the original version of ALS is proportional to K3. Yet, the running time of model building can be important in recommendation systems; if the model cannot keep up with the changing item portfolio and/or user profile, the prediction accuracy can be degraded. In this paper we present novel and fast ALS variants both for the implicit and explicit feedback datasets, which offers better trade-off between running time and accuracy. Due to the significantly lower computational complexity of the algorithm - linear in terms of K - the model being generated under the same amount of time is more accurate, since the faster training enables to build model with more latent factors. We demonstrate the efficiency of our ALS variants on two datasets using two performance measures, RMSE and average relative position (ARP), and show that either a significantly more accurate model can be generated under the same amount of time or a model with similar prediction accuracy can be created faster; for explicit feedback the speed-up factor can be even 5-10.

#! Context has been recognized as an important factor to consider in personalized Recommender Systems. However, most model-based Collaborative Filtering approaches such as Matrix Factorization do not provide a straightforward way of integrating context information into the model. In this work, we introduce a Collaborative Filtering method based on Tensor Factorization, a generalization of Matrix Factorization that allows for a flexible and generic integration of contextual information by modeling the data as a User-Item-Context N-dimensional tensor instead of the traditional 2D User-Item matrix. In the proposed model, called Multiverse Recommendation, different types of context are considered as additional dimensions in the representation of the data as a tensor. The factorization of this tensor leads to a compact model of the data which can be used to provide context-aware recommendations. We provide an algorithm to address the N-dimensional factorization, and show that the Multiverse Recommendation improves upon non-contextual Matrix Factorization up to 30% in terms of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). We also compare to two state-of-the-art context-aware methods and show that Tensor Factorization consistently outperforms them both in semi-synthetic and real-world data - improvements range from 2.5% to more than 12% depending on the data. Noticeably, our approach outperforms other methods by a wider margin whenever more contextual information is available.

#! Recommendation systems suggest items based on user preferences. Collaborative filtering is a popular approach in which recommending is based on the rating history of the system. One of the most accurate and scalable collaborative filtering algorithms is matrix factorization, which is based on a latent factor model. We propose a novel Euclidean embedding method as an alternative latent factor model to implement collaborative filtering. In this method, users and items are embedded in a unified Euclidean space where the distance between a user and an item is inversely proportional to the rating. This model is comparable to matrix factorization in terms of both scalability and accuracy while providing several advantages. First, the result of Euclidean embedding is more intuitively understandable for humans, allowing useful visualizations. Second, the neighborhood structure of the unified Euclidean space allows very efficient recommendation queries. Finally, the method facilitates online implementation requirements such as mapping new users or items in an existing model. Our experimental results confirm these advantages and show that collaborative filtering via Euclidean embedding is a promising approach for online recommender systems.

#! Collaborative filtering algorithms attempt to predict a user's interests based on his past feedback. In real world applications, a user's feedback is often continuously collected over a long period of time. It is very common for a user's interests or an item's popularity to change over a long period of time. Therefore, the underlying recommendation algorithm should be able to adapt to such changes accordingly. However, most existing algorithms do not distinguish current and historical data when predicting the users' current interests. In this paper, we consider a new problem - online evolutionary collaborative filtering, which tracks user interests over time in order to make timely recommendations. We extended the widely used neighborhood based algorithms by incorporating temporal information and developed an incremental algorithm for updating neighborhood similarities with new data. Experiments on two real world datasets demonstrated both improved effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.

#! Social network analysis has attracted increasing attention in recent years. In many social networks, besides friendship links amongst users, the phenomenon of users associating themselves with groups or communities is common. Thus, two networks exist simultaneously: the friendship network among users, and the affiliation network between users and groups. In this paper, we tackle the affiliation recommendation problem, where the task is to predict or suggest new affiliations between users and communities, given the current state of the friendship and affiliation networks. More generally, affiliations need not be community affiliations - they can be a user's taste, so affiliation recommendation algorithms have applications beyond community recommendation. In this paper, we show that information from the friendship network can indeed be fruitfully exploited in making affiliation recommendations. Using a simple way of combining these networks, we suggest two models of user-community affinity for the purpose of making affiliation recommendations: one based on graph proximity, and another using latent factors to model users and communities. We explore the two classes of affiliation recommendation algorithms suggested by these models. We evaluate these algorithms on two real world networks - Orkut and Youtube. In doing so, we motivate and propose a way of evaluating recommenders, by measuring how good the top 50 recommendations are for the average user, and demonstrate the importance of choosing the right evaluation strategy. The algorithms suggested by the graph proximity model turn out to be the most effective and efficient. This use of link prediction techniques for the purpose of affiliation recommendation is, to our knowledge, novel.

#! Collaborative filtering recommendations were designed primarily for individual user models and recommendations. However, nowadays more and more scenarios evolve, in which the recommended items are consumed by groups of users rather than by individuals. This raises the need to uncover the most appropriate group-based collaborative filtering recommendation strategy. In this work we investigate the use of aggregated group data in collaborative filtering recipe recommendations. We present results of a study that exploits recipe ratings provided by families of users, in order to evaluate the accuracy of several group recommendation strategies and weighting models, and analyze the impact of switching strategies, data aggregation heuristics, and group characteristics on the performance of recommendations.

#! The majority of recommender systems are designed to make recommendations for individual users. However, in some circumstances the items to be selected are not intended for personal usage but for a group; e.g., a DVD could be watched by a group of friends. In order to generate effective recommendations for a group the system must satisfy, as much as possible, the individual preferences of the group's members. This paper analyzes the effectiveness of group recommendations obtained aggregating the individual lists of recommendations produced by a collaborative filtering system. We compare the effectiveness of individual and group recommendation lists using normalized discounted cumulative gain. It is observed that the effectiveness of a group recommendation does not necessarily decrease when the group size grows. Moreover, when individual recommendations are not effective a user could obtain better suggestions looking at the group recommendations. Finally, it is shown that the more alike the users in the group are, the more effective the group recommendations are.

#! An increasing number of social networking platforms are giving users the option to endorse entities that they find appealing, such as videos, photos, or even other users. We define this model as a Social Endorsement Network, visualized as a bipartite graph with edges (endorsements) from users to endorsed entities. In this work, we formalize the problem of interactive recommendations in social endorsement networks: given a query of tags and a social endorsement network, the problem is to recommend entities that match the query and also share a significant number of common endorsers. We propose an efficient search engine for the solution of the problem, able to produce high-quality and explainable recommendations. The entire framework is designed in a principled and efficient manner, making it ideal for large-scale systems. In a thorough experimental evaluation on real datasets, we illustrate the efficacy of our methods and provide some valuable insight on social endorsement networks.

#! Recommender systems are becoming tools of choice to select the online information relevant to a given user. Collaborative filtering is the most popular approach to building recommender systems and has been successfully employed in many applications. With the advent of online social networks, the social network based approach to recommendation has emerged. This approach assumes a social network among users and makes recommendations for a user based on the ratings of the users that have direct or indirect social relations with the given user. As one of their major benefits, social network based approaches have been shown to reduce the problems with cold start users. In this paper, we explore a model-based approach for recommendation in social networks, employing matrix factorization techniques. Advancing previous work, we incorporate the mechanism of trust propagation into the model. Trust propagation has been shown to be a crucial phenomenon in the social sciences, in social network analysis and in trust-based recommendation. We have conducted experiments on two real life data sets, the public domain Epinions.com dataset and a much larger dataset that we have recently crawled from Flixster.com. Our experiments demonstrate that modeling trust propagation leads to a substantial increase in recommendation accuracy, in particular for cold start users.

#! Content-centric social websites, such as discussion forums and blog sites, have flourished during the past several years. These sites often contain overwhelming amounts of information that are also being updated rapidly. To help users locate their interests at such sites (e.g., interesting blogs to read or discussion forums to join), researchers have developed a number of recommendation technologies. However, it is difficult to make effective recommendations for new users (a.k.a. the cold start problem) due to a lack of user information (e.g., preferences and interests). Furthermore, the complexity of recommendation algorithms often prevents users from comprehending let alone trusting the recommended results. To tackle the above two challenges, we are building a social map-based recommender system called Pharos. A social map summarizes users' content-related social behavior over time (e.g., reading, writing, and commenting behavior during the past week) as a set of latent communities. Each community is characterized by the theme of the content being discussed and the key people involved. By discovering, ranking, and displaying the most "popular" latent communities, Pharos creates a visual social map of a website. This enables new users to obtain a quick overview of the site, alleviating the cold start problem. Furthermore, we use the social map as a context to help explain Pharos-recommended content and people. Users can also interactively explore the social map to locate their interested content or people that are not being explicitly recommended, compensating for the imperfection in the recommendation algorithms. We have deployed Pharos within our company and our preliminary evaluation shows the usefulness of Pharos.

#! Classical recommender systems provide users with a list of recommendations where each recommendation consists of a single item, e.g., a book or DVD. However, several applications can benefit from a system capable of recommending packages of items, in the form of sets. Sample applications include travel planning with a limited budget (price or time) and twitter users wanting to select worthwhile tweeters to follow given that they can deal with only a bounded number of tweets. In these contexts, there is a need for a system that can recommend top-k packages for the user to choose from. Motivated by these applications, we consider composite recommendations, where each recommendation comprises a set of items. Each item has both a value (rating) and a cost associated with it, and the user specifies a maximum total cost (budget) for any recommended set of items. Our composite recommender system has access to one or more component recommender system, focusing on different domains, as well as to information sources which can provide the cost associated with each item. Because the problem of generating the top recommendation (package) is NP-complete, we devise several approximation algorithms for generating top-k packages as recommendations. We analyze their efficiency as well as approximation quality. Finally, using two real and two synthetic data sets, we subject our algorithms to thorough experimentation and empirical analysis. Our findings attest to the efficiency and quality of our approximation algorithms for top-k packages compared to exact algorithms.

#! All new researchers face the daunting task of familiarizing themselves with the existing body of research literature in their respective fields. Recommender algorithms could aid in preparing these lists, but most current algorithms do not understand how to rate the importance of a paper within the literature, which might limit their effectiveness in this domain. We explore several methods for augmenting existing collaborative and content-based filtering algorithms with measures of the influence of a paper within the web of citations. We measure influence using well-known algorithms, such as HITS and PageRank, for measuring a node's importance in a graph. Among these augmentation methods is a novel method for using importance scores to influence collaborative filtering. We present a task-centered evaluation, including both an offline analysis and a user study, of the performance of the algorithms. Results from these studies indicate that collaborative filtering outperforms content-based approaches for generating introductory reading lists.

#! The objective of a tag recommendation system is to propose a set of tags for a resource to ease the tagging process done manually by a user. Tag recommendation is an interesting and well defined research problem. However, while solving it, it is easy to forget about its practical implications. We discuss the practical aspects of tag recommendation and propose a system that successfully addresses the problem of learning in tag recommendation, without sacrificing efficiency. Learning is realized in two aspects: adaptation to newly added posts and parameter tuning. The content of each added post is used to update the resource and user profiles as well as associations between tags. Parameter tuning allows the system to automatically adjust the way tag sources (e.g., content related tags or user profile tags) are combined to match the characteristics of a specific collaborative tagging system. The evaluation on data from three collaborative tagging systems confirmed the importance of both learning methods. Finally, an architecture based on text indexing makes the system efficient enough to serve in real time collaborative tagging systems with number of posts counted in millions, given limited computing resources.

#! Physical activity motivating game design encourages players to perform real physical activity in order to gain virtual game rewards. Previous research into activity motivating games showed that they have the potential to motivate players to perform physical activity, while retaining the enjoyment of playing. However, it was discovered that a uniform motivating approach resulted in different levels of activity performed by players of varying gaming skills. In this work we present and evaluate two adaptive recommendation-based techniques, which aim to balance the amount of physical activity performed by players by adapting the level of motivation to their observed gaming skills. Experimental evaluation showed that the adaptive techniques not only increase the amount of activity performed and retain the enjoyment of playing, but also balance the amount of activity performed by players of varying gaming skills and allow for game difficulty to be set in a player-dependent manner.

#! Online social networks (OSNs) like Facebook, and Myspace recommend new friends to registered users based on local features of the graph (i.e. based on the number of common friends that two users share). However, OSNs do not exploit the whole structure of the network. Instead, they consider only pathways of maximum length 2 between a user and his candidate friends. On the other hand, there are global approaches, which detect the overall path structure in a network, being computationally prohibitive for huge-size social networks. In this paper, we define a basic node similarity measure that captures effectively local graph features. We also exploit global graph features introducing transitive node similarity. Moreover, we derive variants of our method that apply in signed networks. We perform extensive experimental comparison of the proposed method against existing recommendation algorithms using synthetic and real data sets (Facebook, Hi5 and Epinions). Our experimental results show that our FriendTNS algorithm outperforms other approaches in terms of accuracy and it is also time efficient. We show that a significant accuracy improvement can be gained by using information about both positive and negative edges.

#! In this paper we propose a fully decentralized approach for recommending new contacts in the social network of mobile phone users. With respect to existing solutions, our approach is characterized by some distinguishing features. In particular, the application we propose does not assume any centralized coordination: it transparently collects and processes user information that is accessible in any mobile phone, such as the log of calls, the list of contacts or the inbox/outbox of short messages and exchanges it with other users. This information is used to recommend new friendships to other users. Furthermore, the information needed to perform recommendation is collected and exchanged between users in a privacy preserving way. Finally, information necessary to implement the application is exchanged transparently and opportunistically, by using the residual space in standard short messages occasionally exchanged between users. As a consequence, we do not ask users to change their habits in using SMS.

#! Recently the world of the web has become more social and more real-time. Facebook and Twitter are perhaps the exemplars of a new generation of social, real-time web services and we believe these types of service provide a fertile ground for recommender systems research. In this paper we focus on one of the key features of the social web, namely the creation of relationships between users. Like recent research, we view this as an important recommendation problem -- for a given user, UT which other users might be recommended as followers/followees -- but unlike other researchers we attempt to harness the real-time web as the basis for profiling and recommendation. To this end we evaluate a range of different profiling and recommendation strategies, based on a large dataset of Twitter users and their tweets, to demonstrate the potential for effective and efficient followee recommendation.

#! The reciprocal recommender is a class of recommender system that is important for several tasks where people are both the subjects and objects of the recommendation. Some examples are: job recommendation, mentor-mentee matching, and online dating. Despite the importance of this type of recommender, our work is the first to distinguish it and define its properties. We have implemented RECON, a reciprocal recommender for online dating, and have evaluated it on a large dataset from a major Australian dating website. We investigated the predictive power gained by taking account of reciprocity, finding that it is substantial, for example it improved the success rate of the top ten recommendations from 23% to 42% and also improved the recall at the same time. We also found reciprocity to help with the cold start problem obtaining a success rate of 26% for the top ten recommendations for new users. We discuss the implications of these results for broader uses of our approach for other reciprocal recommenders.

#! In this paper we report our progress in the first application of iterative probabilistic algorithms in the design and evaluation of recommender systems. The proposed iterative recommender system (referred to as BPRS) is based on the belief propagation, a powerful decoding algorithm for turbo codes and Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. The belief propagation algorithm relies on a graph-based representation of an appropriately chosen factor graph for the recommender systems. The factor graph representation of the recommender systems turned out to be a bipartite graph, where the users and products are arranged as two sets of variable and factor nodes that are connected via some edges. Recommendations (predicted ratings) for each particular user can be computed by probabilistic message passing between nodes in the graph. We provide an evaluation of BPRS via computer simulations using the MovieLens dataset. We observed that BPRS iteratively reduces the error in the predicted ratings of the users until it converges. Further, our initial results indicate an improvement in the Mean Average Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) over the Item Averaging. Therefore, we are confident that the belief propagation is a new promising approach which will offer robustness and accuracy for the recommender systems.

#! This paper aims to combine information about users' self-defined social connections with traditional collaborative filtering (CF) to improve recommendation quality. Specifically, in the following, the users' social connections in consideration were groups. Unlike other studies which utilized groups inferred by data mining technologies, we used the information about the groups in which each user explicitly participated. The group activities are centered on common interests. People join a group to share and acquire information about a topic as a form of community of interest or practice. The information of this group activity may be a good source of information for the members. We tested whether adding the information from the users' own groups or group members to the traditional CF-based recommendations can improve the recommendation quality or not. The information about groups was combined with CF using a mixed hybridization strategy. We evaluated our approach in two ways, using the Citeulike data set and a real user study.

#! Collaborative recommendation algorithms are typically evaluated on a static matrix of user rating data. However, when users experience a recommender system, it is dynamic, constantly evolving as new items and new users arrive. The dynamic properties of collaborative recommendation have become important as prediction algorithms based on the interactions of rating histories have been proposed, and as researchers seek to understand problems of robustness and maintenance in rating databases. This paper proposes a new evaluation method for the dynamic aspects of collaborative algorithms, the "temporal leave-one-out" approach, which can provide insight into both user-specific and system-level evolution of recommendation behavior. As a case study, the methodology is applied to the Influence Limiter algorithm [12], showing that its robustness to attack comes at a high accuracy cost.

#! Today's web commercial applications demand more powerful recommendation systems due to the rapid increase in the number of both consumers and available products. Searching for the best algorithm with the highest accuracy and realistic complexity is, most of the time, a very costly process in terms of both time and resources. In this paper we suggest an alternative framework called Hydra which enables the virtual fusion of any and as many currently available recommendation algorithms in such a distributed manner that algorithms' complexities are not summarized but parallelized. Therefore, we utilize the available algorithms and technologies aiming to achieve better accuracy in order to surpass even the most state of the art algorithms. In addition, Hydra can be used to find how algorithms interact with each other in order to estimate the resulting accuracy towards inventing a more precise algorithm diminishing the risk of a failed investment. Hydra can be adjusted and integrated in any recommendation application while it is also open to new functionalities which can be embedded easily and in a transparent manner.

#! Since the development of the comparably simple neighborhood-based methods in the 1990s, a plethora of techniques has been developed to improve various aspects of collaborative filtering recommender systems like predictive accuracy, scalability to large problem instances or the capability to deal with sparse data sets. Many of the recent algorithms rely on sophisticated methods which are based, for instance, on matrix factorization techniques or advanced probabilistic models and/or require a computationally intensive model-building phase. In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of a new and extremely simple prediction method (RF-Rec) that uses the user's and the item's most frequent rating value to make a rating prediction. The evaluation on three standard test data sets shows that the accuracy of the algorithm is on a par with the standard collaborative filtering algorithms on dense data sets and outperforms them on sparse rating databases. At the same time, the algorithm's implementation is trivial, has a high prediction coverage, requires no complex offline pre-processing or model-building phase and can generate predictions in constant time.

#! We present and evaluate various content-based recommendation models that make use of user and item profiles defined in terms of weighted lists of social tags. The studied approaches are adaptations of the Vector Space and Okapi BM25 information retrieval models. We empirically compare the recommenders using two datasets obtained from Delicious and Last.fm social systems, in order to analyse the performance of the approaches in scenarios with different domains and tagging behaviours.

#! Assessing the trustworthiness of reviews is a key issue for the maintainers of opinion sites such as TripAdvisor, given the rewards that can be derived from posting false or biased reviews. In this paper we present a number of criteria that might be indicative of suspicious reviews and evaluate alternative methods for integrating these criteria to produce a unified "suspiciousness" ranking. The criteria derive from characteristics of the network of reviewers and also from analysis of the content and impact of reviews and ratings. The integration methods that are evaluated are singular value decomposition and the unsupervised hedge algorithm. These alternatives are evaluated in a user study on TripAdvisor reviews, where volunteers were asked to rate the suspiciousness of reviews that have been highlighted by the criteria.

#! In this paper, we propose a new method for collaborative filtering (CF)-based recommender systems. Traditional CF-based recommendation algorithms have applied constant settings such as a reference group (neighborhood) size and a significance level to all users. In this paper we develop a new method that identifies optimal personalized settings for each user and applies them to generating recommendations for individual users. Personalized parameters are identified through iterative simulations with 'training' and 'verification' datasets. The method is compared with traditional 'constant settings' methods using Netflix data. The results show that the new method outperforms traditional, ordinary CF. Implications and future research directions are also discussed.

#! Evaluation have been an important subject since the early days of recommender systems. In online test, the click-through rate (CTR) is often adopted as the metric. However, recommended items with higher CTR does not imply higher relevance of two items since factors like item popularity or item serendipity may influence user's click behavior. We argue that the relevance of recommendation system is also desirable in many real applications. Here relevant means relevance in a human perceptible way. Relevant recommendations not only increase the users' trust to the system but are extremely useful for the vast number of anonymous user as their recommendations may only be made based on the current item. In this paper, we empirically examine the relation between the relevance of recommendations and the corresponding CTR with a few representative ItemCF algorithms through online data from a TV show/movie website, Hulu. Experiments show that algorithms with higher overall CTR may not correspond to higher relevance. Thus CTR may not be the optimal metric for online evaluation of recommender systems if producing relevant recommendations is of importance.

A co-authoring network is actually obtained by the projection of a two-mode graph (an authoring graph linking authors to publications they have signed) over the authors set. We show that link prediction performances can be substantially enhanced by analyzing not only the co-authoring network, but also the dual graph obtained by projecting the original two-mode network over the set of publications.

#! When we evaluate the quality of recommender systems (RS), most approaches only focus on the predictive accuracy of these systems. Recent works suggest that beyond accuracy there is a variety of other metrics that should be considered when evaluating a RS. In this paper we focus on two crucial metrics in RS evaluation: coverage and serendipity. Based on a literature review, we first discuss both measurement methods as well as the trade-off between good coverage and serendipity. We then analyze the role of coverage and serendipity as indicators of recommendation quality, present novel ways of how they can be measured and discuss how to interpret the obtained measurements. Overall, we argue that our new ways of measuring these concepts reflect the quality impression perceived by the user in a better way than previous metrics thus leading to enhanced user satisfaction.

#! Semistructured data provides the users of a community-based information system with the flexibility to store information without having to adhere to any predefined, rigid schema. However, such flexibility needs to be used with caution as it can lead to a very heterogeneous data structure and is therefore not feasible in terms of unified data access and search functionality. We present an approach which avoids such proliferation of substructures and provides the inserting user with recommendations, which are responsible for the creation of a commonly used structure. The presented recommendation algorithm adapts the recommendations to the stored information and its structure created by the community.

#! Group Recommendation Systems (GRS) aim at recommending items that are relevant for the joint interest of a group of users. Voting mechanisms assume that users rate all items in order to identify an item that suits the preferences of all group members. This assumption is not feasible in sparse rating scenarios which are common in the recommender systems domain. In this paper we examine an application of voting theory to GRS. We propose a method to accurately determine the winning item while using a minimal set of the group members ratings, assuming that the recommender system has probabilistic knowledge about the distribution of users' ratings of items in the system. Since computing the optimal minimal set of ratings is computationally intractable, we propose two heuristic algorithms that proceed iteratively that aiming atto minimizing the number of required ratings, until identifying a "winning item". Experiments with the Netflix data show that the proposed algorithms reduce the required number of ratings for identifying the "winning item" by more than 50%.

#! A ranking approach, ListRank-MF, is proposed for collaborative filtering that combines a list-wise learning-to-rank algorithm with matrix factorization (MF). A ranked list of items is obtained by minimizing a loss function that represents the uncertainty between training lists and output lists produced by a MF ranking model. ListRank-MF enjoys the advantage of low complexity and is analytically shown to be linear with the number of observed ratings for a given user-item matrix. We also experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of ListRank-MF by comparing its performance with that of item-based collaborative recommendation and a related state-of-the-art collaborative ranking approach (CoFiRank).

#! A recommender system has to collect users' preference data. To collect such data, rating or scoring methods that use rating scales, such as good-fair-poor or a five-point-scale, have been employed. We replaced such collection methods with a ranking method, in which objects are sorted according to the degree of a user's preference. We developed a technique to convert the rankings to scores based on order statistics theory. This technique successfully improved the accuracy of ranking recommended items. However, we targeted only memory-based recommendation algorithms. To test whether or not the use of ranking methods and our conversion technique are effective for wide variety of recommenders, we apply our conversion technique to model-based algorithms.

#! The success of social media has resulted in an information overload problem, where users are faced with hundreds of new contributions, edits and communications at every visit. A prime example of this in social networks is the news or activity feeds, where the actions (friending, commenting, photo sharing, etc) of friends on the network are presented to users in order to inform them of the network activity. In this work we endeavour to reduce the burden on individuals of identifying interesting updates in social network news feeds by automatically identifying and recommending relevant items to individuals where item relevance is based on the observed interactions of the individual with the social network. The results of our offline study show that combining short term interest models, exploiting previous viewing behavior of users, and long-term models, exploiting previous viewing of network actions, was the best predictor of feed item relevance.

#! The efficiency of personal suggestions generated by collaborative filtering techniques is highly dependent on the quality and quantity of the available consumption data. Extending data sets with additional consumption data (from the past) might enrich the user profiles and generally leads to more accurate recommendations. Although if a considerable amount of profile information is already available and detailed personal preferences can be derived, supplementary consumption data may not have any (or a very limited) added value for the recommendation algorithm. These additional consumption data increase the required storage capacity and the computational load to generate the personal recommendations. Moreover, since personal preferences and the relevance of content items may vary over time, older consumption data might be outdated and lead to inaccurate recommendations. Therefore, we investigate which consumption data are (the most) relevant to feed the conventional collaborative filtering algorithms. For provider-generated content systems, we demonstrate that the accuracy of collaborative filtering algorithms increases by extending user profiles with additional older consumption data. In contrast, we witness the opposite effect for user-generated content systems: involving older consumption data has a negative influence on the recommender accuracy. These results are important for website owners who intend to employ a recommendation system at a minimum storage and computation cost.

In this paper we introduce an innovative approach to the multimodal recommender system conceived in the EU METABO project. The most important feature of the METABO Diabetes-Lifestyle Recommender (MED-StyleR) is to generate highly personalized recommendations that satisfy medical prescriptions for patients' long-term health alongside and short-term preferences of patients in their daily lives.

Unlike traditional news filtering approaches, we postulate that a user's preference for particular articles depends not only on the topic and on propositional contents, but also on the user's current context and on more subtle attributes. Our assumption is motivated by the observation that many people read newspapers because they actually enjoy the process. Such sentiments depend on a complex variety of factors. The present study is part of an ongoing effort to bring more advanced personalization to online media. Towards this end, we present a systematic evaluation of the merit of contextual and non-propositional features based on real-life clickstream and postings data. Furthermore, we assess the impact of different recommendation strategies on the learning performance of our system.

#! Recommender systems are intended to assist consumers by making choices from a large scope of items. While most recommender research focuses on improving the accuracy of recommender algorithms, this paper stresses the role of explanations for recommended items for gaining acceptance and trust. Specifically, we present a method which is capable of providing detailed explanations of recommendations while exhibiting reasonable prediction accuracy. The method models the users' ratings as a function of their utility part-worths for those item attributes which influence the users' evaluation behavior, with part-worth being estimated through a set of auxiliary regressions and constrained optimization of their results. We provide evidence that under certain conditions the proposed method is superior to established recommender approaches not only regarding its ability to provide detailed explanations but also in terms of prediction accuracy. We further show that a hybrid recommendation algorithm can rely on the content-based component for a majority of the users, switching to collaborative recommendation only for about one third of the user base.

The so-called real-time web (RTW) is a web of opinions, comments, and personal viewpoints, often expressed in the form of short, 140-character text messages providing abbreviated and personalized commentary in real-time. Twitter is undoubtedly the king of the RTW. It boasts 100+ million users and generates in the region of 50m tweets per day. This RTW data is far from the structured data (ratings, product features, etc.) familiar to recommender systems research, but it is useful to consider its applicability to recommendation scenarios. In this short paper we describe an experiment to look at harnessing the real-time opinions of movie fans, expressed through the Twitter-like short textual reviews available on the Blippr service (www.blippr.com). In particular we describe how users and movies can be represented from the terms used in their associated reviews and describe a number of experiments to highlight the recommendation potential of this RTW data-source and approach.

We evaluate our method, using an offline analysis on publicly available BibSonomy dataset and an online study, showing its effectiveness.

#! This paper investigates the problem of generating on-demand recommendations over a dataset of items where the input is a selection of a few of the items. As an example in the context of a movie dataset, the user may wish to see a list of movies related to the three animation movies 'Finding Nemo', 'Up' and 'Spirited Away'. In this case, it would be expected that the list returned would contain other animation movies like 'Wall-E', 'Princess Mononoke' etc. Thus, this problem can be viewed as a type of "clustering on demand" problem [1]. It is the set form of input that distinguishes this problem from a standard information retrieval problem where the query is usually a single item or an abstraction of a single item in the dataset. In this paper, we present several new approaches to dealing with this problem. We also show some representative results on a movie text dataset.

However, we also found that the rate at which a user provides explicit feedback decreases with time, and that overall leaving explicit feedback has a negative effect on the user's behaviour.

#! Collaborative filtering is a popular approach for building recommender systems. Current collaborative filtering algorithms are accurate but also computationally expensive, and so are best in static off-line settings. It is desirable to include the new data in a collaborative filtering model in an online manner, requiring a model that can be incrementally updated efficiently. Incremental collaborative filtering via co-clustering has been shown to be a very scalable approach for this purpose. However, locally optimized co-clustering solutions via current fast iterative algorithms give poor accuracy. We propose an evolutionary co-clustering method that improves predictive performance while maintaining the scalability of co-clustering in the online phase.

#! In the classical theory of social choice, a set of voters is called to rank a set of alternatives and a social ranking of the alternatives is generated. In this paper, we model recommendation in the context of browsing systems as a social choice problem, where the set of voters and the set of alternatives both coincide with the set of objects in the data collection. We then propose an importance ranking method that strongly resembles the well known PageRank ranking system, and takes into account both the browsing behavior of the users and the intrinsic features of the objects in the collection. We apply the proposed approach in the context of multimedia browsing systems and show that it can generate effective recommendations and can scale well for large data collections.

#! Social matching systems recommend people to other people. With the widespread adoption of smartphones, mobile social matching systems could potentially transform our social landscape. However, we have a limited understanding of what makes a good social match in the mobile context. We present a theoretical framework which outlines how a user's context and the rarity of different affinity measures in various contexts (match rarity) can be used to provide valuable social matches. We suggest that if a user attribute is very rare in a particular context, users will generally be more interested in an affinity match. We conducted a survey study to assess this framework with 117 respondents. We found that both context and match rarity significantly influence interest in a social match. These results validate the key aspects of the framework. We discuss the results in terms of implications for social matching system design.

#! Many works have been proposed in order to improve the recommendation accuracy. Algorithms aiming to improve recommendation accuracy have been developed and evaluated. These algorithms usually work with training data sets which are learned and used to make predictions on users' tastes. The training data set choice is a difficult task not only due to the technical nature of the algorithm used, but also because of the user issues associated with the acquisition of their opinions, since the training data consist of users' opinions. In this work we show the importance of understanding which predictions are impacted when a rating is acquired by developing a naïve active learning criterion based on the number of impacted predictions. To do that, a Rating Impact Analysis method for the user-based collaborative filtering is proposed and applied to the active learning issue.

#! Tagmantic.com is a web based social recommendation and search service which exploits the rich information within folksonomies. By developing multiple layers of organizational structure on top of folksonomies the relations between tags, users and resources can be utilized in order to create advanced recommender engines. The first layer of organizational structure is a tag graph which relates different entities within the folksonomy to each other. Its nodes are the concepts of the folksonomy presented by tags and the edges describe the relationships between these concepts. The second layer of organizational structure are tag clusters, which are build on top of the above mentioned tag graphs and represent the ontology of the underlying folksonomy. These Ontologies as well as the less complex tag graphs are utilized by the recommender algorithms within tagmantic in order to provide a unique and intuitive user experience of exploring and searching content in the internet. The methodology can be applied to different types of folksonomies which implies an enormous potential for future development of new recommender engines.

#! Reciprocal recommender is a class of recommender systems that is important for tasks where people are both the subject and the object of the recommendation; one such task is online dating. We have implemented RECON, a reciprocal recommender for online dating, and we have evaluated it on a major dating website. Results show an improved success rate for recommendations that consider reciprocity in comparison to recommendations that only consider the preferences of the users receiving the recommendations.

#! Despite, or exactly because of the wealth of video content available on the Web, it is often cumbersome to obtain access to exactly the content you like. It is an active process of filtering and making choices, often requiring searches through long lists of alternatives. Building upon the concept of personal TV channels, we demonstrate how Web video content can be seamlessly integrated with broadcast video content, thereby also providing personalized Web content.

#! Recommender systems have emerged as an intelligent information filtering tool to help users effectively identify information items of interest from an overwhelming set of choices and provide personalized services. Studies show that personality influences human decision making process and interests. However, little research has ventured in incorporating it into recommender systems. The utilization of personality characteristics into recommender systems and the exploration of user perception to such systems are the focuses of my thesis. The overall goal is to develop an efficient personality-based recommender system and to arrive at a series of design guidelines from the perspective of human computer interaction. In this paper, I present my up-to-date results on a proposed personality-based music recommender prototype, user perception investigations, and my ongoing research about addressing new user problem by utilizing personality characteristics. Finally, I shall present future works.

#! The use of Vector Space Models (VSM) in the area of Information Retrieval is an established practice within the scientific community. The reason is twofold: first, its very clean and solid formalism allows us to represent objects in a vector space and to perform calculations on them. On the other hand, as proved by many contributions, its simplicity does not hurt the effectiveness of the model. Although Information Retrieval and Information Filtering undoubtedly represent two related research areas, the use of VSM in Information Filtering is much less analzyed. The goal of this work is to investigate the impact of vector space models in the Information Filtering area. Specifically, I will introduce two approaches: the first one, based on a technique called Random Indexing, reduces the impact of two classical VSM problems, this is to say its high dimensionality and the inability to manage the semantics of documents. The second extends the previous one by integrating a negation operator implemented in the Semantic Vectors1 open-source package. The results emerged from an experimental evaluation performed on a large dataset and the applicative scenarios opened by these approaches confirmed the effectiveness of the model and induced to investigate more these techniques.

#! Context-aware recommender systems are becoming a popular topic, still, there are many untouched aspects. In this paper, research involving context identification and the concepts related to hybrid and context-aware systems is presented. A conceptual architecture for a context-aware recommender system for movies and TV shows is furthermore introduced. The system consists of a number of processes for context identification and recommendation. Key contextual features are identified and used for the creation of several sets of recommendations, based on the predicted context. The main focus of the research presented here is the identification of context, which in turn is used for recommendation. The results will be evaluated and incorporated into the recommendation engine of movie and TV recommendation website Moviepilot.

#! Nowadays, many companies deploy social media technologies to foster the knowledge transfer in the enterprise. As the amount of available content in such systems grows, there is an increasing need for recommender systems that provide recommendations according to the knowledge workers' needs and preferences. We propose a topic-based recommender system for Enterprise 2.0 resource sharing platforms. The system identifies the knowledge workers' short-term and long-term topics of interest by applying algorithms from the domain of topic detection and tracking and generates recommendations with a high degree of inter-topic diversity.

#! User modeling, adaptation, and personalization techniques have hit the mainstream. The explosion of social network websites, on-line user-generated content platforms, and the tremendous growth in computational power of mobile devices are generating incredibly large amounts of user data, and an increasing desire of users to "personalize" (their desktop, e-mail, news site, phone). The potential value of personalization has become clear both as a commodity for the benefit or enjoyment of end-users, and as an enabler of new or better services -- a strategic opportunity to enhance and expand businesses. An exciting characteristic of recommender systems is that they draw the interest of industry and businesses while posing very interesting research and scientific challenges. In spite of significant progress in the research community, and industry efforts to bring the benefits of new techniques to end-users, there are still important gaps that make personalization and adaptation difficult for users. Research activities still often focus on narrow problems, such as incremental accuracy improvements of current techniques, sometimes with ideal hypotheses, or tend to overspecialize on a few applicative problems (typically TV or movie recommenders -- sometimes simply because of the availability of data). This restrains de facto the range of other applications where personalization technologies might be useful as well. Thus, we may have reached a good point to take a step back to seek perspective in the research done in recommender systems. This workshop contrives for a new uptake on past experiences and lessons learned. We propose an analytic outlook on new research directions, or ones that still require substantial research, with a special focus on their practical adoption in working applications, and the barriers to be met in this path. This workshop is an opportunity to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss, on one hand, the main lessons drawn from successes but also from failures of recommender systems, and on the other hand, identify and analyze the major research areas in recommendation and personalization technologies that should be addressed in the future for a practical, effective take-up of the needs of vendors, consumers, and technology providers. Selected papers fall into the following areas. Limits of recommender systems: main bottlenecks, research dead ends and myths in recommender systems; missing technology pieces for wider adoption; social (privacy, culture) issue. Analytical view of personalization experiences: case studies of recommender system implementations & deployments; evaluation and user studies of recommender systems, scalability in large recommender systems, lessons learnt from your past experience, obstacles to massive deployment of recommendation solutions in industrial environment. Recommender systems in broader systems: place of recommender systems in complete systems, killer application are. Next needs in recommender systems: new business models related to recommendation, social and cultural impact of recommender systems, new paradigms to provide recommendations, new areas for recommendations, users' expectations about future recommender systems, beyond one-shot recommendations: recommendations of sequences, goal-oriented recommendations. The workshop combines short paper presentations with open discussion sessions. Papers are grouped by topics allowing us to organize an open discussion for every topic. The workshop has received twelve submissions. The list of accepted papers and the workshop schedule can be found at the workshop's homepage: http://ir.ii.uam.es/prsat201

#! The exponential growth of the Social Web both poses challenges, and presents opportunities for Recommender System research. The Social Web has turned information consumers into active contributors who generate large volumes of rapidly changing online data. Recommender Systems strive to identify relevant content for users at the right time and in the right context but achieving this goal has become more difficult, in part due to the volume and nature of information contributed through the Social Web. The emergence of the Social Web marked a change in Web users' attitude to online privacy and sharing. Social media systems encourage users to implicitly and explicitly provide large volumes of information which previously they would have been reluctant to share. This information includes personal details such as location, age, and interests, friendship networks, bookmarks and tags, opinion and preferences which can be captured explicitly or more often by monitoring user interaction with the systems (e.g. commenting, friending, rating,tagging etc). These new sources of knowledge can be leveraged by Recommender Systems to improve existing techniques and develop new strategies which focus on social recommendation. In turn recommender technologies can play a huge part in fuelling the success of the Social Web phenomenon by reducing the information overload problem facing social media users. The goal of this one day workshop was to bring together researchers and practitioners to explore, discuss, and understand challenges and new opportunities for Recommender Systems and the Social Web. The workshop consisted both of technical sessions, in which selected participants presented their results or ongoing research, as well as informal breakout sessions on more focused topics. Papers discussing various aspects of recommender system in the Social Web were submitted and selected for presentation and discussion in the workshop in a formal reviewing process. The topics of the submitted papers included, among others, the following main areas: Case studies and novel fielded social recommender applications Economy of community-based systems: Using recommenders to encourage users to contribute and sustain participation Social network and folksonomy development: Recommending friends, tags, bookmarks, blogs, music, communities etc. Recommender system mash-ups, Web 2.0 user interfaces, rich media recommender systems Recommender applications involving users and groups directly in the recommendation process Exploiting folksonomies, social network information, interaction user context and communities or groups for recommendations Trust and reputation aware social recommendations Semantic Web recommender systems, use of ontologies and microformats Empirical evaluation of social recommender techniques, success and failure measures Social recommender systems in the enterprise The list of short papers, the workshop schedule and downloadable versions of the papers can be found at the workshop's homepage at: http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~ssanand/RSWEb.htm and are also published at: http://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/Publications/CEUR-WS/

#! We welcome you to the 5th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (ACM RecSys 2011) held in Chicago on October 23-27, 2011. Over the last several years, ACM RecSys has become a flagship event in the area of recommender systems, where leading researchers and practitioners from around the world have an opportunity to meet and discuss their latest results and solutions. This year, ACM RecSys had 169 submissions from 42 different countries that were sent out for review. As was the case in the last few years, there were two paper submission categories: long papers (that should report on substantial contributions of lasting value) and short papers (that typically discuss exciting new work that is not yet mature enough for a long paper). Out of 110 long paper submissions, 22 were accepted (20.0%) for oral presentation at the conference. In addition, to accommodate the growing number of quality long paper submissions over the years, 8 additional long papers were accepted for poster presentation (resulting in the final acceptance rate of 27.3% for long paper submissions). Out of 59 short paper submissions, 24 were accepted (40.7%) for poster presentation at the conference. In addition to the paper presentations, the conference program includes a multitude of other interesting events. These events include: two keynotes, one from an academic perspective by Noshir Contractor (Northwestern University) and one from an industrial perspective by Neel Sundaresan (eBay Research Labs); a highly diverse industry track featuring Andrew Tomkins (Google), Rajat Raina (Facebook), Jon Sanders (Netflix), Pankaj Gupta (Twitter) and Eric Bieschke (Pandora); a record number of nine workshops; three invited tutorials; a doctoral symposium; and a panel on the latest emerging issues that are important to the field.

In this paper we take a top-down view of recommender systems and identify challenges, opportunities, and approaches in building recommender systems for a marketplace platform. We use eBay as an example where the elaborate interaction offers a number opportunities for creative recommendations. However, eBay also poses complexities resulting from high sparsity of relationships. Our discussion can be generalized beyond eBay to other marketplaces.

#! The world of music is changing rapidly. We are now just a few clicks away from being able to listen to nearly any song that has ever been recorded. This easy access to a nearly endless supply of music is changing how we explore, discover, share and experience music. As the world of online music grows, music recommendation and discovery tools become an increasingly important way for music listeners to engage with music. Commercial recommenders such as Last.fm, iTunes Genius and Pandora have enjoyed commercial and critical success. But how well do these systems really work? How good are the recommendations? How far into the "long tail" do these recommenders reach? In this tutorial we look at the current state-of-the-art in music recommendation and discovery. We examine current commercial and research systems, focusing on the advantages and the disadvantages of the various recommendation strategies. We look at some of the challenges in building music recommenders and we explore some of the novel techniques that are being used to improve future music recommendation and discovery systems.

#! The possibility of designing user rating profiles to deliberately and maliciously manipulate the recommendation output of a collaborative filtering system was first raised in 2002. One scenario proposed was that an author, motivated to increase recommendations of his book, might create a set of false profiles that rate the book highly, in an effort to artificially promote the ratings given by the system to genuine users. Several attack models have been proposed and the performance of these attacks in terms of influencing the system predictions has been evaluated for a number of memory-based and model-based collaborative filtering algorithms. Moreover, strategies have been proposed to enhance the robustness of existing algorithms and new algorithms have been proposed with built-in attack resistance. This tutorial will review the work that has taken place in the last decade on robustness of recommendation algorithms and seek to examine the question of the importance of robustness in future research.

#* Recommendations as a conversation with the user
#@ Daniel Tunkelang
#t 2011
#c 9
#! Recommender systems provide users with products or content intended to satisfy their information needs. The primary evaluation measures for recommender systems emphasize either the perceived relevance of the recommendations or the actions driven by those recommendations (e.g., purchases on ecommerce sites or clicks on news and social networking sites). Unfortunately, this transactional emphasis neglects the inherently interactive nature of the user experience. This tutorial explores recommendations as part of a conversation between users and systems. A conversational approach should provide transparency, control, and guidance. Transparency means that users understand why systems offer particular recommendations. Control means that users can explicitly manipulate the behavior of recommender systems based on personal needs and preferences. Guidance means that systems offers plausible and predictable next steps rather than requiring users to guess the consequences of their interactions. Finally, there are psychological factors -- in particular, the faith that users place in the recommender system's effectiveness. Since users develop mental models of recommender systems, the system should become more predictable with repeated use. The tutorial does not require any special background in interfaces or usability. Rather, it summarizes the best lessons from research and industry, offering concrete examples and practical techniques to make recommender systems most effective for users.

#! Predicting user "ratings" on items is a crucial task in recommender systems. Matrix factorization methods that computes a low-rank approximation of the incomplete user-item rating matrix provide state-of-the-art performance, especially for users and items with several past ratings (warm starts). However, it is a challenge to generalize such methods to users and items with few or no past ratings (cold starts). Prior work [4][32] have generalized matrix factorization to include both user and item features for performing better regularization of factors as well as provide a model for smooth transition from cold starts to warm starts. However, the features were incorporated via linear regression on factor estimates. In this paper, we generalize this process to allow for arbitrary regression models like decision trees, boosting, LASSO, etc. The key advantage of our approach is the ease of computing --- any new regression procedure can be incorporated by "plugging" in a standard regression routine into a few intermediate steps of our model fitting procedure. With this flexibility, one can leverage a large body of work on regression modeling, variable selection, and model interpretation. We demonstrate the usefulness of this generalization using the MovieLens and Yahoo! Buzz datasets.

#! We propose a bayesian probabilistic model for explicit preference data. The model introduces a generative process, which takes into account both item selection and rating emission to gather into communities those users who experience the same items and tend to adopt the same rating pattern. Each user is modeled as a random mixture of topics, where each topic is characterized by a distribution modeling the popularity of items within the respective user-community and by a distribution over preference values for those items. The proposed model can be associated with a novel item-relevance ranking criterion, which is based both on item popularity and user's preferences. We show that the proposed model, equipped with the new ranking criterion, outperforms state-of-art approaches in terms of accuracy of the recommendation list provided to users on standard benchmark datasets.

#! Traditional collaborative filtering (CF) methods suffer from sparse or even cold-start problems, especially for new established recommenders. However, since there are now quite a few recommender systems already existing in good working order, their data should be valuable to the new-start recommenders. This paper proposes shared collaborative filtering approach to leverage the data from other parties (contributor party) to improve own (beneficiary party's) CF performance, and at the same time the privacy of other parties cannot be compromised. Item neighborhood list is chosen as the shared data from the contributor party with considering differential privacy. And an innovative algorithm called neighborhood boosting is proposed to make the beneficiary party leverage the shared data. MovieLens and Netflix data sets are considered as two parties to simulate and evaluate the proposed shared CF approach. The experiment results validate the positive effects of shared CF for increasing the recommendation accuracy of the beneficiary party. Especially when the beneficiary party's data is quite sparse, the performance can be increased by around 10%. The experiments also show that shared CF even outperforms the methods that incorporate the detailed original rating scores of the contributor party without considering the privacy issues. The proposed shared CF approach obtains a win-win situation for both performance and privacy.

#! Recommender systems have to deal with the cold start problem as new users and/or items are always present. Rating elicitation is a common approach for handling cold start. However, there still lacks a principled model for guiding how to select the most useful ratings. In this paper, we propose a principled approach to identify representative users and items using representative-based matrix factorization. Not only do we show that the selected representatives are superior to other competing methods in terms of achieving good balance between coverage and diversity, but we also demonstrate that ratings on the selected representatives are much more useful for making recommendations (about 10% better than competing methods). In addition to illustrating how representatives help solve the cold start problem, we also argue that the problem of finding representatives itself is an important problem that would deserve further investigations, for both its practical values and technical challenges.

In addition, to accommodate the growing number of quality long paper submissions over the years, 8 additional long papers were accepted for poster presentation (resulting in the final acceptance rate of 27.3% for long paper submissions). Out of 59 short paper submissions, 24 were accepted (40.7%) for poster presentation at the conference. In addition to the paper presentations, the conference program includes a multitude of other interesting events. These events include: two keynotes, one from an academic perspective by Noshir Contractor (Northwestern University) and one from an industrial perspective by Neel Sundaresan (eBay Research Labs); a highly diverse industry track featuring Andrew Tomkins (Google), Rajat Raina (Facebook), Jon Sanders (Netflix), Pankaj Gupta (Twitter) and Eric Bieschke (Pandora); a record number of nine workshops; three invited tutorials; a doctoral symposium; and a panel on the latest emerging issues that are important to the field.

#! This paper looks inside FolkRank, one of the well-known folksonomy-based algorithms, to present its fundamental properties and promising possibilities for improving performance in tag recommendations. Moreover, we introduce a new way to compute a differential approach in FolkRank by representing it as a linear combination of the personalized PageRank vectors. By the linear combination, we present FolkRank's probabilistic interpretation that grasps how FolkRank works on a folksonomy graph in terms of the random surfer model. We also propose new FolkRank-like methods for tag recommendations to efficiently compute tags' rankings and thus reduce expensive computational cost of FolkRank. We show that the FolkRank approaches are feasible to recommend tags in real-time scenarios as well. The experimental evaluations show that the proposed methods provide fast tag recommendations with reasonable quality, as compared to FolkRank. Additionally, we discuss the diversity of the top n tags recommended by FolkRank and its variants.

#! The rapidly increasing availability of online social networks and the well-known effect of social influence have motivated research on social-network based recommenders. Social influence and selection together lead to the formation of communities of like-minded and well connected users. Exploiting the clustering of users and items is one of the most important approaches for model-based recommendation. Users may belong to multiple communities or groups, but only a few clustering algorithms allow clusters to overlap. One of these algorithms is the probabilistic EM clustering method, which assumes that data is generated from a mixture of Gaussian models. The mixed membership stochastic block model (MMB) transfers the idea of EM clustering from conventional, non-relational data to social network data. In this paper, we introduce a generalized stochastic blockmodel (GSBM) that models not only the social relations but also the rating behavior. This model learns the mixed group membership assignments for both users and items in an SRN. GSBM can predict the future behavior of users, both the rating of items and creation of links to other users. We performed experiments on two real life datasets from Epinions.com and Flixster.com, demonstrating the accuracy of the proposed GSBM for rating prediction as well as link prediction.

#! Online Social Rating Networks (SRNs) such as Epinions and Flixter, allow users to form several implicit social networks, through their daily interactions like co-commenting on the same products, or similarly co-rating products. The majority of earlier work in Rating Prediction and Recommendation of products (e.g. Collaborative Filtering) mainly takes into account ratings of users on products. However, in SRNs users can also built their explicit social network by adding each other as friends. In this paper, we propose Social-Union, a method which combines similarity matrices derived from heterogeneous (unipartite and bipartite) explicit or implicit SRNs. Moreover, we propose an effective weighting strategy of SRNs influence based on their structured density. We also generalize our model for combining multiple social networks. We perform an extensive experimental comparison of the proposed method against existing rating prediction and product recommendation algorithms, using synthetic and two real data sets (Epinions and Flixter). Our experimental results show that our Social-Union algorithm is more effective in predicting rating and recommending products in SRNs.

#! Recommender systems predict user preferences based on a range of available information. For systems in which users generate streams of content (e.g., blogs, periodically-updated newsfeeds), users may rate the produced content that they read, and be given accurate predictions about future content they are most likely to prefer. We design a distributed mechanism for predicting user ratings that avoids the disclosure of information to a centralized authority or an untrusted third party: users disclose the rating they give to certain content only to the user that produced this content. We demonstrate how rating prediction in this context can be formulated as a matrix factorization problem. Using this intuition, we propose a distributed gradient descent algorithm for its solution that abides with the above restriction on how information is exchanged between users. We formally analyse the convergence properties of this algorithm, showing that it reduces a weighted root mean square error of the accuracy of predictions. Although our algorithm may be used many different ways, we evaluate it on the Neflix data set and prediction problem as a benchmark. In addition to the improved privacy properties that stem from its distributed nature, our algorithm is competitive with current centralized solutions. Finally, we demonstrate the algorithm's fast convergence in practice by conducting an online experiment with a prototype user-generated content exchange system implemented as a Facebook application.

#! Research in recommender systems is now starting to recognise the importance of multiple selection criteria to improve the recommendation output. In this paper, we present a novel approach to multi-criteria recommendation, based on the idea of clustering users in "preference lattices" (partial orders) according to their criteria preferences. We assume that some selection criteria for an item (product or a service) will dominate the overall ranking, and that these dominant criteria will be different for different users. Following this assumption, we cluster users based on their criteria preferences, creating a "preference lattice". The recommendation output for a user is then based on ratings by other users from the same or close clusters. Having introduced the general approach of clustering, we proceed to formulate three alternative recommendation methods instantiating the approach: (a) using the aggregation function of the criteria, (b) using the overall item ratings, and (c) combining clustering with collaborative filtering. We then evaluate the accuracy of the three methods using a set of experiments on a service ranking dataset, and compare them with a conventional collaborative filtering approach extended to cover multiple criteria. The results indicate that our third method, which combines clustering and extended collaborative filtering, produces the highest accuracy.

#! Despite the growing popularity of Context-Aware Recommender Systems (CARSs), only limited work has been done on how contextual recommendations affect the behavior of customers in real-life settings. In this paper, we study the effects of contextual recommendations on the purchasing behavior of customers and their trust in the provided recommendations. In particular, we did live controlled experiments with real customers of a major commercial Italian retailer in which we compared the customers' purchasing behavior and measured their trust in the provided recommendations across the contextual, content-based and random recommendations. As a part of this study, we have investigated the role of accuracy and diversity of recommendations on customers' behavior and their trust in the provided recommendations for the three types of RSes. We have demonstrated that the context-aware RS outperformed the other two RSes in terms of accuracy, trust and other economics-based performance metrics across most of our experimental settings.

#! In many applications, flexibility of recommendation, which is the capability of handling multiple dimensions and various recommendation types, is very important. In this paper, we focus on the flexibility of recommendation and propose a graph-based multidimensional recommendation method. We consider the problem as an entity ranking problem on the graph which is constructed using an implicit feedback dataset (e.g. music listening log), and we adapt Personalized PageRank algorithm to rank entities according to a given query that is represented as a set of entities in the graph. Our model has advantages in that not only can it support the flexibility, but also it can take advantage of exploiting indirect relationships in the graph so that it can perform competitively with the other existing recommendation methods without suffering from the sparsity problem.

#! This paper proposes an algorithm to estimate appropriate or novel content for groups of people who know each other such as friends, couples, and families. To achieve high recommendation accuracy, we focus on "Groupality", the entity or entities that characterize groups such as the tendency of content selection and the relationships among group members. Our algorithm calculates recommendation scores using a feature space that consists of the behavioral tendency of a group and the power balance among group members based on individual preference and the behavioral history of group. After gathering the behavioral history of subject groups when watching TV, we verify that our proposed algorithm can recommend appropriate content, and find novel content. Evaluations show that our proposal achieves higher performance than existing methods.

#! The Recommender Systems community is paying increasing attention to novelty and diversity as key qualities beyond accuracy in real recommendation scenarios. Despite the raise of interest and work on the topic in recent years, we find that a clear common methodological and conceptual ground for the evaluation of these dimensions is still to be consolidated. Different evaluation metrics have been reported in the literature but the precise relation, distinction or equivalence between them has not been explicitly studied. Furthermore, the metrics reported so far miss important properties such as taking into consideration the ranking of recommended items, or whether items are relevant or not, when assessing the novelty and diversity of recommendations. We present a formal framework for the definition of novelty and diversity metrics that unifies and generalizes several state of the art metrics. We identify three essential ground concepts at the roots of novelty and diversity: choice, discovery and relevance, upon which the framework is built. Item rank and relevance are introduced through a probabilistic recommendation browsing model, building upon the same three basic concepts. Based on the combination of ground elements, and the assumptions of the browsing model, different metrics and variants unfold. We report experimental observations which validate and illustrate the properties of the proposed metrics.

#! We propose a collaborative filtering (CF) recommendation framework, which is based on viewing user feedback on products as ordinal, rather than the more common numerical view. This way, we do not need to interpret each user feedback value as a number, but only rely on the more relaxed assumption of having an order among the different feedback ratings. Such an ordinal view frequently provides a more natural reflection of the user intention when providing qualitative ratings, allowing users to have different internal scoring scales. Moreover, we can address scenarios where assigning numerical scores to different types of user feedback would not be easy. Our approach is based on a pointwise ordinal model, which allows it to linearly scale with data size. The framework can wrap most collaborative filtering algorithms, upgrading those algorithms designed to handle numerical values into being able to handle ordinal values. In particular, we demonstrate our framework with wrapping a leading matrix factorization CF method. A cornerstone of our method is its ability to predict a full probability distribution of the expected item ratings, rather than only a single score for an item. One of the advantages this brings is a novel approach to estimating the confidence level in each individual prediction. Compared to previous approaches to confidence estimation, ours is more principled and empirically superior in its accuracy. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach on some of the largest publicly available datasets, the Netflix data, and the Yahoo! Music data.

#! Recommendations from the long tail of the popularity distribution of items are generally considered to be particularly valuable. On the other hand, recommendation accuracy tends to decrease towards the long tail. In this paper, we quantitatively examine this trade-off between item popularity and recommendation accuracy. To this end, we assume that there is a selection bias towards popular items in the available data. This allows us to define a new accuracy measure that can be gradually tuned towards the long tail. We show that, under this assumption, this measure has the desirable property of providing nearly unbiased estimates concerning recommendation accuracy. In turn, this also motivates a refinement for training collaborative-filtering approaches. In various experiments with real-world data, including a user study, empirical evidence suggests that only a small, if any, bias of the recommendations towards less popular items is appreciated by users.

#! Recommender systems research is being slowed by the difficulty of replicating and comparing research results. Published research uses various experimental methodologies and metrics that are difficult to compare. It also often fails to sufficiently document the details of proposed algorithms or the evaluations employed. Researchers waste time reimplementing well-known algorithms, and the new implementations may miss key details from the original algorithm or its subsequent refinements. When proposing new algorithms, researchers should compare them against finely-tuned implementations of the leading prior algorithms using state-of-the-art evaluation methodologies. With few exceptions, published algorithmic improvements in our field should be accompanied by working code in a standard framework, including test harnesses to reproduce the described results. To that end, we present the design and freely distributable source code of LensKit, a flexible platform for reproducible recommender systems research. LensKit provides carefully tuned implementations of the leading collaborative filtering algorithms, APIs for common recommender system use cases, and an evaluation framework for performing reproducible offline evaluations of algorithms. We demonstrate the utility of LensKit by replicating and extending a set of prior comparative studies of recommender algorithms --- showing limitations in some of the original results --- and by investigating a question recently raised by a leader in the recommender systems community on problems with error-based prediction evaluation.

#! This paper compares five different ways of interacting with an attribute-based recommender system and shows that different types of users prefer different interaction methods. In an online experiment with an energy-saving recommender system the interaction methods are compared in terms of perceived control, understandability, trust in the system, user interface satisfaction, system effectiveness and choice satisfaction. The comparison takes into account several user characteristics, namely domain knowledge, trusting propensity and persistence. The results show that most users (and particularly domain experts) are most satisfied with a hybrid recommender that combines implicit and explicit preference elicitation, but that novices and maximizers seem to benefit more from a non-personalized recommender that just displays the most popular items.

#! Netflix.com uses star ratings, Digg.com uses up/down votes and Facebook uses a "like" but not a "dislike" button. Despite the popularity and diversity of these rating scales, research offers little guidance for designers choosing between them. This paper compares four different rating scales: unary ("like it"), binary (thumbs up / thumbs down), five-star, and a 100-point slider. Our analysis draws upon 12,847 movie and product review ratings collected from 348 users through an online survey. We a) measure the time and cognitive load required by each scale, b) study how rating time varies with the rating value assigned by a user, and c) survey users' satisfaction with each scale. Overall, users work harder with more granular rating scales, but these effects are moderated by item domain (product reviews or movies). Given a particular scale, users rating times vary significantly for items they like and dislike. Our findings about users' rating effort and satisfaction suggest guidelines for designers choosing between rating scales.

#! This research was motivated by our interest in understanding the criteria for measuring the success of a recommender system from users' point view. Even though existing work has suggested a wide range of criteria, the consistency and validity of the combined criteria have not been tested. In this paper, we describe a unifying evaluation framework, called ResQue (Recommender systems' Quality of user experience), which aimed at measuring the qualities of the recommended items, the system's usability, usefulness, interface and interaction qualities, users' satisfaction with the systems, and the influence of these qualities on users' behavioral intentions, including their intention to purchase the products recommended to them and return to the system. We also show the results of applying psychometric methods to validate the combined criteria using data collected from a large user survey. The outcomes of the validation are able to 1) support the consistency, validity and reliability of the selected criteria; and 2) explain the quality of user experience and the key determinants motivating users to adopt the recommender technology. The final model consists of thirty two questions and fifteen constructs, defining the essential qualities of an effective and satisfying recommender system, as well as providing practitioners and scholars with a cost-effective way to evaluate the success of a recommender system and identify important areas in which to invest development resources.

#! In the past decade large scale recommendation datasets were published and extensively studied. In this work we describe a detailed analysis of a sparse, large scale dataset, specifically designed to push the envelope of recommender system models. The Yahoo! Music dataset consists of more than a million users, 600 thousand musical items and more than 250 million ratings, collected over a decade. It is characterized by three unique features: First, rated items are multi-typed, including tracks, albums, artists and genres; Second, items are arranged within a four level taxonomy, proving itself effective in coping with a severe sparsity problem that originates from the unusually large number of items (compared to, e.g., movie ratings datasets). Finally, fine resolution timestamps associated with the ratings enable a comprehensive temporal and session analysis. We further present a matrix factorization model exploiting the special characteristics of this dataset. In particular, the model incorporates a rich bias model with terms that capture information from the taxonomy of items and different temporal dynamics of music ratings. To gain additional insights of its properties, we organized the KddCup-2011 competition about this dataset. As the competition drew thousands of participants, we expect the dataset to attract considerable research activity in the future.

#! Law enforcement and intelligence agencies have long realized that analysis of co-offending networks, networks of offenders who have committed crimes together, is invaluable for crime investigation, crime reduction and prevention. Investigating crime can be a challenging and difficult task, especially in cases with many potential suspects and inconsistent witness accounts or inconsistencies between witness accounts and physical evidence. We present here a novel approach to crime suspect recommendation based on partial knowledge of offenders involved in a crime incident and a known co-offending network. To solve this problem, we propose a random walk based method for recommending the top-K potential suspects. By evaluating the proposed method on a large crime dataset for the Province of British Columbia, Canada, we show experimentally that this method outperforms baseline random walk and association rule-based methods. Additionally, results obtained for public domain data from experiments for co-author recommendation on a DBLP co-authorship network are consistent with those on the crime dataset. Compared to the crime dataset, the performance of all competitors is much better on the DBLP dataset, confirming that crime suspect recommendation is an inherently harder task.

#! Activity streams have emerged as a means to syndicate updates about a user or a group of users within a social network site or a set of sites. As the flood of updates becomes highly intensive and noisy, users are faced with a "needle in a haystack" challenge when they wish to read the news most interesting to them. In this work, we study activity stream personalization as a means of coping with this challenge. We experiment with an enterprise activity stream that includes status updates and news across a variety of social media applications. We examine an entity-based user profile and a stream-based profile across three dimensions: people, terms, and places, and provide a rich set of results through a user study that combines direct rating of the objects in the profile with rating of the news items it produces.

#! In this paper, a new approach to predicting the structure of a social network without any prior knowledge from the social links is proposed. In absence of links among nodes, we assume there are other information resources associated with the nodes which are called node profiles. The task of link prediction and recommendation from text data is to learn similarities between the nodes and then translate pair-wise similarities into social links. In other words, the process is to convert a similarity matrix into an adjacency matrix. In this paper, an alternative approach is proposed. First, hidden topics of node profiles are learned using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Then, by mapping node-topic and topic-topic relations, a new structure called semi-bipartite graph is generated which is slightly different from regular bipartite graph. Finally, by applying topological metrics such as Katz and short path scores to the new structure, we are able to rank and recommend relevant links to each node. The proposed technique is applied to several co-authorship networks. While most link prediction methods are low precision solutions, the proposed method performs effectively and offers high precision.

#! Collaborative filtering (CF), one of the most successful recommendation approaches, continues to attract interest in both academia and industry. However, one key issue limiting the success of collaborative filtering in certain application domains is the cold-start problem, a situation where historical data is too sparse (known as the sparsity problem), new users have not rated enough items (known as the new user problem), or both. In this paper, we aim at addressing the cold-start problem by incorporating human personality into the collaborative filtering framework. We propose three approaches: the first is a recommendation method based on users' personality information alone; the second is based on a linear combination of both personality and rating information; and the third uses a cascade mechanism to leverage both resources. To evaluate their effectiveness, we have conducted an experimental study comparing the proposed approaches with the traditional rating-based CF in two cold-start scenarios: sparse data sets and new users. Our results show that the proposed CF variations, which consider personality characteristics, can significantly improve the performance of the traditional rating-based CF in terms of the evaluation metrics MAE and ROC sensitivity.

#! In this paper we propose a market-based approach for seeding recommendations for new items in which publishers bid to have items presented to the most influential users for each item. Users are able to select (or not) items for rating on an earn-per-rating basis, with payment given for providing a rating regardless of whether the rating is positive or negative. This approach reduces the time taken to obtain ratings for new items, while encouraging users to give honest ratings (to increase their influence) which in turn supports the quality of recommendations. To support this approach we propose techniques for inferring the social influence network from users' rating vectors and recommendation lists. Using this influence network we apply existing heuristics for estimating a user's influence, adapting them to account for the new items already presented to a user. We also propose an extension to Chen et al.'s Degree Discount heuristic [Chen et al. 2009], to enable it to be used in this context. We evaluate our approach on the MovieLens dataset and show that we are able to reduce the time taken to achieve coverage, while supporting the quality of recommendations.

#! Collaborative filtering, being a popular method for generating recommendations, produces satisfying results for users by providing extremely relevant items. Despite being popular, however, this method is prone to many problems. One of these problems is popularity bias, in which the system becomes skewed towards items that are popular amongst the general user population. These 'obvious' items are, technically, extremely relevant items but fail to be novel. In this paper, we maintain using collaborative filtering methods while still managing to produce novel yet relevant items. This is achieved by utilizing the long-tailed distribution of listening behavior of users, in which their playlists are biased towards a few songs while the rest of the songs, those in the long tail, have relatively low play counts. In addition, we also apply a link analysis method to users and define links between them to create an increasingly fine-grained approach in calculating weights for the recommended items. The proposed recommendation method was available online as a user study in order to measure the relevancy and novelty of the recommended items. Results show that the algorithm manages to include novel recommendations that are still relevant, and shows the potential for a new way of generating novel recommendations.

#! Matrix factorization (MF) has evolved as one of the most accurate approaches to collaborative filtering. In this paper, we extend the probabilistic MF framework as to account for multiple observations for each matrix element. This significantly improves the accuracy of recommender systems in several areas: (1) aggregation of ratings concerning items organized hierarchically, (2) (partial) compensation for the selection bias in the observed data by using an appropriate prior with virtual data points, and (3) improved recommendations of TV shows. While our framework applies to explicit and implicit feedback data, we outline in detail the latter application in this paper: we present the first approach that takes into account also negative feedback when training on implicit feedback data. Moreover, we shed light on the implicit assumptions underlying the most successful approach to IP-TV (Internet Protocol Television) recommendations in [Hu et al. 2008]. In our experiments, we obtain significant improvements over the existing approach.

#! In item-based collaborative filtering, a critical intermediate step to personalized recommendations is the definition of an item-similarity metric. Existing algorithms compute the item-similarity using the user-to-item ratings (cosine, Pearson, Jaccard, etc.). When computing the similarity between two items A and B many of these algorithms divide the actual number of co-occurring users by some "difficulty" of co-occurrence. We refine this approach by defining item similarity as the ratio of the actual number of co-occurrences to the number of co-occurrences that would be expected if user choices were random. In the final step of our method to compute personalized recommendations we apply the usage history of a user to the item similarity matrix. The well defined probabilistic meaning of our similarities allows us to further improve this final step. We measured the quality of our algorithm on a large real-world data-set. As part of Comcast's efforts to improve its personalized recommendations of movies and TV shows, several top recommender companies were invited to apply their algorithms to one year of Video-on-Demand usage data. Our algorithm tied for first place. This paper includes a MapReduce pseudo code implementation of our algorithm.

#! The broad motivation for our research is to build manipulation resistant news recommender systems. However, there can be several different algorithms that are used to generate news recommendations, and the strategies for manipulation resistance are likely specific to the algorithm (or class of algorithm) employed. In this paper we will focus on a common method used by many media sites of recommending the N most read (or popular) articles (e.g. New York Times, BBC, Wall Street Journal all prominently use this). Through simulation results we show that whereas recommendation of the N most read articles is easily susceptible to manipulation, a simple probabilistic variant is more robust to common manipulation strategies. Further, for the "N most read" recommender, probabilistic selection has other desirable properties. Specifically, the (N+1)th article, which may have "just" missed making the cutoff, is unduly penalized under common user models. Small differences initially are easily amplified -- an observation that can be used by manipulators. Probabilistic selection, on the other hand, creates no such artificial penalty. We also use classical results from urn models to derive theoretical results for special cases.

#! Collaborative Filtering (CF) based recommender systems often suffer from the sparsity problem, particularly for new and inactive users when they use the system. The emerging trend of social networking sites and their accommodation in other sites like e-commerce can potentially help alleviate the sparsity problem with their provided social relation data. In this paper, we have particularly explored a new kind of social relation, the membership, and its combined effect with friendship. The two type of heterogeneous social relations are fused into the CF recommender via a factorization process. Due to the two relations' respective properties, we adopt different fusion strategies: regularization was leveraged for friendship and collective matrix factorization (CMF) was proposed for incorporating membership. We further developed a unified model to combine the two relations together and tested it with real large-scale datasets at five sparsity levels. The experiment has not only revealed the significant effect of the two relations, especially the membership, in augmenting recommendation accuracy in the sparse data condition, but also identified the ability of our fusing model in achieving the desired fusion performance.

#! Context-aware music recommender systems suggest music items taking into consideration contextual conditions, such as the user mood or location, that may influence the user preferences at a particular moment. In this paper we consider a particular kind of context-aware recommendation task: selecting music suited for a place of interest (POI), which the user is visiting, and that is illustrated in a mobile travel guide. We have designed an approach for this novel recommendation task by matching music to POIs using emotional tags. In order to test our approach, we have developed a mobile application that suggests an itinerary and plays recommended music for each visited POI. The results of the study show that users judge the recommended music suited for the POIs, and the music is rated higher when it is played in this usage scenario.

#! Collaborative filtering (CF) is an effective recommendation technique, which selects items for an individual user based on similar users' preferences. However, CF may not fully reflect the procedure how people choose an item in real life, for users are more likely to ask friends for opinions instead of asking similar strangers. Recently, some recommendation methods based on social network have been raised. These approaches incorporate social network into the CF algorithms and users' preferences can be influenced by the favors of their friends. These social approaches require the knowledge of similarities among friends. There are two popular similarity functions: Vector Space Similarity (VSS) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). However, both friends similarity functions are based on the item-sets they rated in common. In most cases, these functions are impractical, i.e. if two friends do not share the same items in common, the similarity between them will be zeros. To solve this problem, we propose an Adaptive Social Similarity (ASS) function based on the matrix factorization technique. We conduct our experiment on a large dataset: Epinions, which is a widely-used dataset with social information. The experiment results illustrate that our approach outperforms the baseline models and achieves a better performance than social-based method in [4].

#! Group recommender systems (RS) are used to support groups in making common decisions when considering a set of alternatives. Current approaches generate group recommendations based on the users' individual preferences models. We believe that members of a group can reach an agreement more effectively by exchanging proposals suggested by a conventional RS. We propose to use a critiquing RS that has been shown to be effective in single-user recommendation. In the group recommendation context, critiquing allows each user to get new recommendations similar to the proposals made by the other group members and to communicate the rationale behind their own counterproposals. We describe a mobile application implementing the proposed approach and its evaluation in a live user experiment.

#! A proactive recommender system pushes recommendations to the user when the current situation seems appropriate, without explicit user request. This is conceivable in mobile scenarios such as restaurant or gas station recommendations. In this paper, we present a model for proactivity in mobile recommender systems. The model relies on domain-dependent context modeling in several categories. The recommendation process is divided into two phases to first analyze the current situation and then examine the suitability of particular items. We have implemented a prototype gas station recommender and conducted a survey for evaluation. Results showed good correlation of the output of our system with the assessment of users regarding the question when to generate recommendations.

#! The ever blurring line between online interactions and physical encounters presents an interesting challenge when recommending events. Events created on social networking sites may have ambiguous location scope. The location information provided may be fuzzy or non existent and additionally the reach and radius of interest in the event can vary greatly. In this work, we identify four categories of events: global, location dependent and socially independent, socially dependent and location independent, and location and socially dependent. We classify events from an organizations internal event management service where the location of the event is unknown, but the location of the attendees are known in order to improve scoping of event recommendations. Our results, investigate the impact of ignoring location properties when recommending events using classic collaborative filtering techniques. Additionally, once global and socially independent events are identified, they can be used to provide recommendations to new users, addressing the cold-start problem.

#! Rating sparsity is a critical issue for collaborative filtering. For example, the well-known Netflix Movie rating data contain ratings of only about 1% user-item pairs. One way to address this rating sparsity problem is to develop more effective methods for training rating prediction models. To this end, in this paper, we introduce a collective training paradigm to automatically and effectively augment the training ratings. Essentially, the collective training paradigm builds multiple different Collaborative Filtering (CF) models separately, and augments the training ratings of each CF model by using the partial predictions of other CF models for unknown ratings. Along this line, we develop two algorithms, Bi-CF and Tri-CF, based on collective training. For Bi-CF and Tri-CF, we collectively and iteratively train two and three different CF models via iteratively augmenting training ratings for individual CF model. We also design different criteria to guide the selection of augmented training ratings for Bi-CF and Tri-CF. Finally, the experimental results show that Bi-CF and Tri-CF algorithms can significantly outperform baseline methods, such as neighborhood-based and SVD-based models.

#! One important challenge in the field of recommender systems is the sparsity of available data. This problem limits the ability of recommender systems to provide accurate predictions of user ratings. We overcome this problem by using the publicly available user generated information contained in Wikipedia. We identify similarities between items by mapping them to Wikipedia pages and finding similarities in the text and commonalities in the links and categories of each page. These similarities can be used in the recommendation process and improve ranking predictions. We find that this method is most effective in cases where ratings are extremely sparse or nonexistent. Preliminary experimental results on the MovieLens dataset are encouraging.

This resulted in a renewed information overload problem, but it also provided a new and unforeseen way of gathering useful, accurate and constantly updated information about user interests and tastes. Content-based recommender systems can leverage the wealth of data emerging by social networks for building user profiles in which representations of the user interests are maintained. The idea proposed in this paper is to extract content-based user profiles from the data available in the LinkedIn social network, to have an image of the users' interests that can be used to recommend interesting academic research papers. A preliminary experiment provided interesting results which deserve further attention.

The proposed solution has the advantage of smaller computational cost and provides the possibility to represent at different granularities the interaction between context and items. We have exploited the proposed model in two recommendation applications: places of interest and music.

It addresses two common scenarios in collaborative filtering: rating prediction (e.g. on a scale of 1 to 5 stars) and item prediction from positive-only implicit feedback (e.g. from clicks or purchase actions). The library offers state-of-the-art algorithms for those two tasks. Programs that expose most of the library's functionality, plus a GUI demo, are included in the package. Efficient data structures and a common API are used by the implemented algorithms, and may be used to implement further algorithms. The API also contains methods for real-time updates and loading/storing of already trained recommender models. MyMediaLite is free/open source software, distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). Its methods have been used in four different industrial field trials of the MyMedia project, including one trial involving over 50,000 households.

However, the way such models have been tested may not be a realistic setting for recommendation. In this paper, we evaluated rating prediction and top-N recommendation tasks using a MF model with and without temporal dynamic terms under two evaluation settings. Our experiments show that the addition of dynamic parameters do not necessarily yield to better results on these tasks when a more strict time-aware separation of train/test data is performed, and moreover, results may vary notably when different evaluation schemes are used.

#! In this paper, we initially provide an experimental study on the evolution of user interests in real-world news recommender systems, and then propose a novel recommendation approach, in which the long-term and short-term reading preferences of users are seamlessly integrated when recommending news items. Given a hierarchy of newly-published news articles, news groups that the user might prefer are differentiated using the long-term profile, and then in each selected news group, a list of news items are chosen based on the short-term user profile. Extensive empirical experiments on a collection of news articles obtained from various popular news websites demonstrate the efficacy of our method.

#! As recommender systems are increasingly deployed in the real world, they are not merely tested offline for precision and coverage, but also "online" with test users to ensure good user experience. The user evaluation of recommenders is however complex and resource-consuming. We introduce a pragmatic procedure to evaluate recommender systems for experience products with test users, within industry constraints on time and budget. Researchers and practitioners can employ our approach to gain a comprehensive understanding of the user experience with their systems.

#! We address the problem of recommending suitable jobs to people who are seeking a new job. We formulate this recommendation problem as a supervised machine learning problem. Our technique exploits all past job transitions as well as the data associated with employees and institutions to predict an employee's next job transition. We train a machine learning model using a large number of job transitions extracted from the publicly available employee profiles in the Web. Experiments show that job transitions can be accurately predicted, significantly improving over a baseline that always predicts the most frequent institution in the data.

#! In this paper, we design a recommender system for the post-purchase stage, i.e., after a user purchases a product. Our method combines both behavioral and content aspects of recommendations. We first find the most related categories for the active product in the post-purchase stage. Among these related categories, products with high behavioral relevance and content relevance are recommended to the user. In addition, our algorithm considers the temporal factor, i.e., the purchase time of the active product and the recommendation time. We apply our algorithm on a random sample of the purchase data from eBay. Comparing to the baseline item-based collaborative filtering approach, our hybrid recommender system achieves significant coverage and purchase rate gain for different time windows.

#! There is considerable methodological divergence in the way precision-oriented metrics are being applied in the Recommender Systems field, and as a consequence, the results reported in different studies are difficult to put in context and compare. We aim to identify the involved methodological design alternatives, and their effect on the resulting measurements, with a view to assessing their suitability, advantages, and potential shortcomings. We compare five experimental methodologies, broadly covering the variants reported in the literature. In our experiments with three state-of-the-art recommenders, four of the evaluation methodologies are consistent with each other and differ from error metrics, in terms of the comparative recommenders' performance measurements. The other procedure aligns with RMSE, but shows a heavy bias towards known relevant items, considerably overestimating performance.

#! The explosive growth of online social networks in recent times has presented a powerful source of information to be utilised in personalised recommendations. Unsurprisingly there has already been a large body of work completed in the recommender system field to incorporate this social information into the recommendation process. In this paper we examine the practice of leveraging a user's social graph in order to generate recommendations. Using various neighbourhood selection strategies, we examine the user satisfaction and the level of perceived trust in the recommendations received.

#! The bias towards popular items is not necessarily an undesired outcome of recommender algorithms since a large amount of revenue on e-commerce websites is drawn from these popular items. On the other hand, in domains such as online dating and employment websites, where users and items of the recommendation are both people, a strong bias towards popular users may cause these users to feel overwhelmed and unpopular users to feel neglected. In this paper, we use collaborative filtering (CF) to generate recommendations for all users, and by using stochastic matching we select a number of reciprocal recommendations for each user that maximizes the matches among all users. In this way, all users, regardless of their popularity, will receive the same number of recommendations the number of times they will be recommended to others. This study is the first to apply a stochastic matching solution to balance the number of recommendations given to users in a CF setting. Using historical data, we demonstrate that the proposed recommender improves the chance of finding a successful relationship in comparison to CF recommendations.

We use historical posts on some focal topic or historical links to a focal blog channel to recommend a set of authors to follow. Such a system would be useful for brand managers interested in monitoring conversations about their products. Our recommendations are based on a prediction system that trains a ranking Support Vector Machine (RSVM) using multiple features including the content of a post, similarity between posts, links between posts and/or blog channels, and links to external websites. We solve two problems, Future Author Prediction (FAP) and Future Link Prediction (FLP), and apply the prediction outcome to make recommendations. Using an extensive experimental evaluation on a blog dataset, we demonstrate the quality and value of our recommendations.

#! Standard Sentiment Analysis applies Natural Language Processing methods to assess an "approval" value of a given text, categorizing it into "negative", "neutral", or "positive" or on a linear scale. Sentiment Analysis can be used to infer ratings values for users based on textual reviews of items such as books, films, or products. We propose an approach to generalizing the concept to multiple dimensions to estimate user ratings along multiple axes such as "service", "price" and "value". We use Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and derive a mathematical model that can be used as a multivariate regression tool. This model has a number of valuable properties: it can be trained offline and used efficiently on live stream of texts like blogs and tweets, can be used for visualization and data clustering and labeling, and finally it can potentially be incorporated into natural language product search algorithms. At the end we propose an evaluation procedure that can be used on live data when a ground truth is not available. Based on this model we present our preliminary results from empirical data that we have collected from our system Opinion Space1. We show that for this dataset the CCA model outperforms the PCA that was originally used in Opinion Space.

#! Today's group recommender systems do not consider unavailable, inaccessible, or incomplete user information of one ore more members within a group. This is a problem for mobile group recommender system, because changed user behaviour or technical limitations of mobile services let user may not be willing or able to disclose all information, which are part of a user profile in a mobile environment. For location information, as one of the most important type of user information for an ad-hoc mobile recommendation service, this can lead to inaccurate, or missing location information. Inaccurate or missing location information has an impact on different parts of building group recommendations. This impact reduces the quality of recommendations, which is a key-challenge of recommender systems. Therefore, design guidelines are needed to address the problem of missing or inaccurate location information in mobile group recommender systems. This work describes the approach of building and validating those design guidelines and gives a first idea of impacts.

#! Group and social recommender systems aim to recommend items of interest to a group or a community of people. The user issues in such systems cannot be addressed by examining the satisfaction of their members as individuals. Rather, group satisfaction should be studied as a result of the interaction and interface methods that support group dynamics and interaction. In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art in user experience design of group and social recommender systems. We further apply the techniques used in the current recommender systems to GroupFun, a music social group recommender system. After presenting the interface and interaction characteristics of GroupFun, we further analyze the design space and propose areas for future research in pursuit of an affective recommender.

Accurate analysis and preprocessing of web usage data and efficient web usage clustering are the key factors that influence the development of clustering based implicit recommender system. We propose an analysis and preprocessing model to tackle the poor quality of web usage data. To address the problem of efficient web usage clustering, we propose a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based clustering approach. Having shown our PSO based clustering performs well; we extend it for mining the usage behavior of web users. We select Java API (Application Programming Interface) documentation usage data as a case study for our recommender system.

#! Performance prediction has gained growing attention in the Information Retrieval field since the late nineties and has become an established research topic in the field. Our work restates the problem in the area of Recommender Systems, where it has barely been researched so far, despite being an appealing problem, as it enables an array of strategies for deciding when to deliver or hold back recommendations based on their foreseen accuracy. We investigate the adaptation and definition of different performance predictors based on the available user and item features. The properties of the predictor are empirically studied by checking the correlation of the predictor output with a performance measure. Then, we propose to introduce the performance predictor in a recommender system to produce a dynamic strategy. Depending on how the predictor is introduced we analyze two different problems: dynamic neighbor weighting in collaborative filtering and dynamic weighting of ensemble recommenders.

#! We explore how consumer preferences at the time of consumption are impacted by predictions generated by recommender systems. We conducted three controlled laboratory experiments to explore the effects of system recommendations on preferences. Results provide strong evidence that the rating provided by a recommender system serves as an anchor for the consumer's constructed preference. Consumer's preferences appear malleable and can be significantly influenced by the recommendation received. Additionally, the effects of pure number-based anchoring can be separated from the effects of the perceived reliability of a recommender system. In particular, when the recommender system was described to the participants as being in testing phase, the anchoring effect was reduced. Finally, the effect of anchoring is roughly continuous, operating over a range of perturbations of the system.

#! The exponential growth of the social web poses challenges and new opportunities for recommender systems. The social web has turned information consumers into active contributors creating massive amounts of information. Finding relevant and interesting content at the right time and in the right context is challenging for existing recommender approaches. At the same time, social systems by their definition encourage interaction between users and both online content and other users, thus generating new sources of knowledge for recommender systems. Web 2.0 users explicitly provide personal information and implicitly express preferences through their interactions with others and the system (e.g. commenting, friending, rating, etc.). These various new sources of knowledge can be leveraged to improve recommendation techniques and develop new strategies which focus on social recommendation. The Social Web provides huge opportunities for recommender technology and in turn recommender technologies can play a part in fuelling the success of the Social Web phenomenon. The goal of this one day workshop was to bring together researchers and practitioners to explore, discuss, and understand challenges and new opportunities for Recommender Systems and the Social Web. The workshop consisted both of technical sessions, in which selected participants presented their results or ongoing research, as well as informal breakout sessions on more focused topics. Papers discussing various aspects of recommender system in the Social Web were submitted and selected for presentation and discussion in the workshop in a formal reviewing process: Case studies and novel fielded social recommender applications; Economy of community-based systems: Using recommenders to encourage users to contribute and sustain participation.; Social network and folksonomy development: Recommending friends, tags, bookmarks, blogs, music, communities etc.; Recommender systems mash-ups, Web 2.0 user interfaces, rich media recommender systems; Collaborative knowledge authoring, collective intelligence; Recommender applications involving users or groups directly in the recommendation process; Exploiting folksonomies, social network information, interaction, user context and communities or groups for recommendations; Trust and reputation aware social recommendations; Semantic Web recommender systems, use of ontologies or microformats; Empirical evaluation of social recommender techniques, success and failure measures Full workshop details are available at http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~ssanand/RSWeb11/index.htm

In all these scenarios, users have to solve a decision task. The major focuses of this workshop (Decisions@RecSys) were approaches for efficient human decision making in different types of recommendation scenarios.

A variety of digital traces can now be used to infer how people move about their city and extract their context and habits. Personalization and recommender systems, potentially merged with the data that people store online (e.g., social networks, web ratings), can then not only be used to recommend new places and events that they may find interesting to attend, but, more broadly, personalize and enhance any service that people find themselves using. The goal of this one-day workshop was to bring together researchers and practitioners to explore, discuss, and understand challenges and new opportunities for personalisation within the urban domain.

#! The new opportunities for applying recommendation techniques within Social Web platforms and applications as well as the various new sources of information which have become available in the Web 2.0 and can be incorporated in future recommender applications are a strong driving factor in current recommender system research for various reasons: (1) Social systems by their definition encourage interaction between users and both online content and other users, thus generating new sources of knowledge for recommender systems. Web 2.0 users explicitly provide personal information and implicitly express preferences through their interactions with others and the system (e.g. commenting, friending, rating, etc.). These various new sources of knowledge can be leveraged to improve recommendation techniques and develop new strategies which focus on social recommendation. (2) New application areas for recommender systems emerge with the popularity of the Social Web. Recommenders cannot only be used to sort and filter Web 2.0 and social network information, they can also support users in the information sharing process, e.g., by recommending suitable tags during folksonomy development. (3) Recommender technology can assist Social Web systems through increasing adoption and participation and sustaining membership. Through targeted and timely intervention which stimulates traffic and interaction, recommender technology can play its role in sustaining the success of the Social Web. (4) The Social Web also presents new challenges for recommender systems, such as the complicated nature of human-to-human interaction which comes into play when recommending people and can require more interactive and richer recommender systems user interfaces. The technical papers appearing in these proceedings aim to explore and understand challenges and new opportunities for recommender systems in the Social Web and were selected in a formal review process by an international program committee. Overall, we received 13 paper submissions from 12 different countries, out of which 7 long papers and 1 short paper were selected for presentation and inclusion in the proceedings. The submitted papers addressed a variety of topics related to Social Web recommender systems from the use of microblogging data for personalization over new tag recommendation approaches to social media-based personalization of news.

#! It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2012 RecSys Workshop on Personalizing the Local Mobile Experience. The growing popularity of location-enabled mobile phones and location-based services offers a great opportunity to apply personalization and recommender system technology to people's everyday lives. Personalization and recommender systems can be used to recommend new places and events that users may find interesting to visit, but, more broadly, these technologies can be used to personalize and enhance any service that people find themselves using. But how do we model such behaviors, what type of innovative applications, interfaces and interactions can we design, what types of content can we recommend and how do we engage, persuade and incentivize users while on-the-move? Location-based recommendations are everywhere. Recommendations for local places, things, and even people nearby are now standard practice across many commercial services; mobile ads, Google mobile search, foursquare recommendations, Yelp, Tripadvisor, etc. But how well are these actually suited to people's local needs? And how much fun is it to explore the world through the lens of recommendations? Our active RecSys 2012 workshop program explores local mobile experiences from two directions. First, we examine the role of personalization and recommendation in local mobile applications through interactive presentations and discussions by technical paper authors. Second, we'll spend half a day exploring Dublin using local recommender systems, on-the-spot. We'll be using commercial systems, and any services that participants themselves may have built -- and we'll explore what's great, what's missing, and where our research should be heading. The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for researchers and developers from both academia and industry to exchange experiences, insights and strategies in (1) personalizing local mobile applications and (2) generating local recommendations that fit local user needs. We aim to generate an overview of local considerations that can be applied by both researchers and practitioners in their work, to spur on future research and to have fun! We hope that the workshop proceedings and learning outcomes from the outdoor activity will serve as a valuable, thought-provoking resource for designers, researchers and developers working within the local mobile recommendation space.

#! It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 6th ACM Recommender Systems Conference (ACM RecSys 2012), held in Dublin, Ireland on September 9-13. As RecSys enters the second half of its first decade, it has clearly established itself as the premier international venue for research and development in the field of Recommender Systems, where leading researchers and practitioners from around the world meet and discuss their latest results and solutions. The growing maturity of the conference is reflected through several changes in the program as compared to previous years: the tutorial program includes four exciting tutorials, which, for the first time, were not invited, but rather submitted and rigorously reviewed. We also put a special emphasis on soliciting demonstrations, leading to a record number of 10 demos accepted to the conference. In addition, this year continues the tradition of attractive collocated workshops, with a total of 8. Finally, 8 PhD students have been accepted to participate in the Doctoral Symposium. In parallel to growing and diversifying participation opportunities, the selectivity of the short paper track was substantially increased, while the competitive acceptance rate of the long paper track was maintained. Overall, the number of paper submissions went up almost 10% as compared to last year, with a total of 185 submissions.

#! The web provides an unprecedented opportunity to accelerate innovation by evaluating ideas quickly and accurately using controlled experiments (e.g., A/B tests and their generalizations). Whether for front-end user-interface changes, or backend recommendation systems and relevance algorithms, online controlled experiments are now utilized to make data-driven decisions at Amazon, Microsoft, eBay, Facebook, Google, Yahoo, Zynga, and at many other companies. While the theory of a controlled experiment is simple, and dates back to Sir Ronald A. Fisher's experiments at the Rothamsted Agricultural Experimental Station in England in the 1920s, the deployment and mining of online controlled experiments at scale--thousands of experiments now--has taught us many lessons. We provide an introduction, share real examples, key learnings, cultural challenges, and humbling statistics.

#! There is an increasing consensus in the field of recommender systems that we should move beyond the offline evaluation of algorithms towards a more user-centric approach. This tutorial teaches the essential skills involved in conducting user experiments, the scientific approach to user-centric evaluation. Such experiments are essential in uncovering how and why the user experience of recommender systems comes about.

#! In 2006, Netflix announced the Netflix Prize, a machine learning and data mining competition for movie rating prediction. We offered $1 million to whoever improved the accuracy of our existing system called Cinematch by 10%. We conducted this competition to find new ways to improve the recommendations we provide to our members, which is a key part of our business. However, we had to come up with a proxy question that was easier to evaluate and quantify: the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predicted rating. A year into the competition, the Korbell team won the first Progress Prize with an 8.43% improvement. They reported more than 2000 hours of work in order to come up with the final combination of 107 algorithms that gave them this prize. And, they gave us the source code. We looked at the two underlying algorithms with the best performance in the ensemble. To put these algorithms to use, we had to work to overcome some limitations, for instance that they were built to handle 100 million ratings, instead of the more than 5 billion that we have, and that they were not built to adapt as members added more ratings. But once we overcame those challenges, we put the two algorithms into production, where they are still used as part of our recommendation engine. You might be wondering what happened with the final Grand Prize ensemble that won the $1M two years later. This is a truly impressive compilation and culmination of years of work, blending hundreds of predictive models to finally cross the finish line. We evaluated some of the new methods offline but the additional accuracy gains that we measured did not seem to justify the engineering effort needed to bring them into a production environment. This example highlights the fact that, besides improving offline metrics such as the RMSE, recommender systems need to take into account other practical issues such as scalability or deployment. In this tutorial, we go over some of those practical issues that many times are as important as the theory, if not more, in order to build an industrial-scale real-world recommender system.

#! We address the problem of optimizing recommender systems for multiple relevance objectives that are not necessarily aligned. Specifically, given a recommender system that optimizes for one aspect of relevance, semantic matching (as defined by any notion of similarity between source and target of recommendation; usually trained on CTR), we want to enhance the system with additional relevance signals that will increase the utility of the recommender system, but that may simultaneously sacrifice the quality of the semantic match. The issue is that semantic matching is only one relevance aspect of the utility function that drives the recommender system, albeit a significant aspect. In talent recommendation systems, job posters want candidates who are a good match to the job posted, but also prefer those candidates to be open to new opportunities. Recommender systems that recommend discussion groups must ensure that the groups are relevant to the users' interests, but also need to favor active groups over inactive ones. We refer to these additional relevance signals (job-seeking intent and group activity) as extraneous features, and they account for aspects of the utility function that are not captured by the semantic match (i.e. post-CTR down-stream utilities that reflect engagement: time spent reading, sharing, commenting, etc). We want to include these extraneous features into the recommendations, but we want to do so while satisfying the following requirements: 1) we do not want to drastically sacrifice the quality of the semantic match, and 2) we want to quantify exactly how the semantic match would be affected as we control the different aspects of the utility function. In this paper, we present an approach that satisfies these requirements. We frame our approach as a general constrained optimization problem and suggest ways in which it can be solved efficiently by drawing from recent research on optimizing non-smooth rank metrics for information retrieval. Our approach features the following characteristics: 1) it is model and feature agnostic, 2) it does not require additional labeled training data to be collected, and 3) it can be easily incorporated into an existing model as an additional stage in the computation pipeline. We validate our approach in a revenue-generating recommender system that ranks billions of candidate recommendations on a daily basis and show that a significant improvement in the utility of the recommender system can be achieved with an acceptable and predictable degradation in the semantic match quality of the recommendations.

#! Performing accurate suggestions is an objective of paramount importance for effective recommender systems. Other important and increasingly evident objectives are novelty and diversity, which are achieved by recommender systems that are able to suggest diversified items not easily discovered by the users. Different recommendation algorithms have particular strengths and weaknesses when it comes to each of these objectives, motivating the construction of hybrid approaches. However, most of these approaches only focus on optimizing accuracy, with no regard for novelty and diversity. The problem of combining recommendation algorithms grows significantly harder when multiple objectives are considered simultaneously. For instance, devising multi-objective recommender systems that suggest items that are simultaneously accurate, novel and diversified may lead to a conflicting-objective problem, where the attempt to improve an objective further may result in worsening other competing objectives. In this paper we propose a hybrid recommendation approach that combines existing algorithms which differ in their level of accuracy, novelty and diversity. We employ an evolutionary search for hybrids following the Strength Pareto approach, which isolates hybrids that are not dominated by others (i.e., the so called Pareto frontier). Experimental results on two recommendation scenarios show that: (i) we can combine recommendation algorithms in order to improve an objective without significantly hurting other objectives, and (ii) we allow for adjusting the compromise between accuracy, diversity and novelty, so that the recommendation emphasis can be adjusted dynamically according to the needs of different users.

#! One of the unresolved issues when designing a recommender system is the number of ratings -- i.e., the profile length -- that should be collected from a new user before providing recommendations. A design tension exists, induced by two conflicting requirements. On the one hand, the system must collect "enough"ratings from the user in order to learn her/his preferences and improve the accuracy of recommendations. On the other hand, gathering more ratings adds a burden on the user, which may negatively affect the user experience. Our research investigates the effects of profile length from both a subjective (user-centric) point of view and an objective (accuracy-based) perspective. We carried on an offline simulation with three algorithms, and a set of online experiments involving overall 960 users and four recommender algorithms, to measure which of the two contrasting forces influenced by the number of collected ratings -- recommendations relevance and burden of the rating process -- has stronger effects on the perceived quality of the user experience. Moreover, our study identifies the potentially optimal profile length for an explicit, rating based, and human controlled elicitation strategy.

#! This paper presents an interactive hybrid recommendation system that generates item predictions from multiple social and semantic web resources, such as Wikipedia, Facebook, and Twitter. The system employs hybrid techniques from traditional recommender system literature, in addition to a novel interactive interface which serves to explain the recommendation process and elicit preferences from the end user. We present an evaluation that compares different interactive and non-interactive hybrid strategies for computing recommendations across diverse social and semantic web APIs. Results of the study indicate that explanation and interaction with a visual representation of the hybrid system increase user satisfaction and relevance of predicted content.

#! Users of social recommender systems may want to inspect and control how their social relationships influence the recommendations they receive, especially since recommendations of social recommenders are based on friends rather than anonymous "nearest neighbors". We performed an online user experiment (N=267) with a Facebook music recommender system that gives users control over the recommendations, and explains how they came about. The results show that inspectability and control indeed increase users' perceived understanding of and control over the system, their rating of the recommendation quality, and their satisfaction with the system.

#! Social media sites have used recommender systems to suggest items users might like but are not already familiar with. These items are typically movies, books, pictures, or songs. Here we consider an alternative class of items - pictures posted by design-conscious individuals. We do so in the context of a mobile application in which users find "cool" items in the real world, take pictures of them, and share those pictures online. In this context, temporal dynamics matter, and users would greatly profit from ways of identifying the latest design trends. We propose a new way of recommending trending pictures to users, which unfolds in three steps. First, two types of users are identified - those who are good at uploading trends (trend makers) and those who are experienced in discovering trends (trend spotters). Second, based on what those "special few" have uploaded and rated, trends are identified early on. Third, trends are recommended using existing algorithms. Upon the complete longitudinal dataset of the mobile application, we compare our approach's performance to a traditional recommender system's.

#! The Social Web is successfully established, and steadily growing in terms of users, content and services. People generate and consume data in real-time within social networking services, such as Twitter, and increasingly rely upon continuous streams of messages for real-time access to fresh knowledge about current affairs. In this paper, we focus on analyzing social streams in real-time for personalized topic recommendation and discovery. We consider collaborative filtering as an online ranking problem and present Stream Ranking Matrix Factorization - RMFX -, which uses a pairwise approach to matrix factorization in order to optimize the personalized ranking of topics. Our novel approach follows a selective sampling strategy to perform online model updates based on active learning principles, that closely simulates the task of identifying relevant items from a pool of mostly uninteresting ones. RMFX is particularly suitable for large scale applications and experiments on the "476 million Twitter tweets" dataset show that our online approach largely outperforms recommendations based on Twitter's global trend, and it is also able to deliver highly competitive Top-N recommendations faster while using less space than Weighted Regularized Matrix Factorization (WRMF), a state-of-the-art matrix factorization technique for Collaborative Filtering, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach.

#! Recommendation accuracy can be improved by incorporating trust relationships derived from social networks. Most recent work on social network based recommendation is focused on minimizing the root mean square error (RMSE). Social network based top-k recommendation, which recommends to a user a small number of items at a time, is not well studied. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on improving the accuracy of top-k recommendation using social networks. We first show that the existing social-trust enhanced Matrix Factorization (MF) models can be tailored for top-k recommendation by including observed and missing ratings in their training objective functions. We also propose a Nearest Neighbor (NN) based top-k recommendation method that combines users' neighborhoods in the trust network with their neighborhoods in the latent feature space. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets show that social networks can significantly improve the top-k hit ratio, especially for cold start users. Surprisingly, we also found that the technical approach for combining feedback data (e.g. ratings) with social network information that works best for minimizing RMSE works poorly for maximizing the hit ratio, and vice versa.

#! The very large majority of recommender systems are running as server-side applications, and they are controlled by the content provider, i.e., who provides the recommended items. This paper focuses on a different scenario: the user is supposed to be able to access content from multiple providers, in our application they offer radio channels, and it is up to a personal recommender installed on the clients' side to decide which channel to select and recommend to the user. We exploit the implicit feedback derived from the user's listening behavior, and we model channel recommendation as a sequential decision making problem. We have implemented a personal RS that integrates reinforcement learning techniques to decide what channel to play every time the user asks for a new music track or the current track finishes playing. In a live user study we show that the proposed system can sequentially select the next channel to play such that the users listen to the streamed tracks for a larger fraction, and for more time, compared to a baseline system not exploiting implicit feedback.

#! Two flavors of the recommendation problem are the explicit and the implicit feedback settings. In the explicit feedback case, users rate items and the user-item preference relationship can be modelled on the basis of the ratings. In the harder but more common implicit feedback case, the system has to infer user preferences from indirect information: presence or absence of events, such as a user viewed an item. One approach for handling implicit feedback is to minimize a ranking objective function instead of the conventional prediction mean squared error. The naive minimization of a ranking objective function is typically expensive. This difficulty is usually overcome by a trade-off: sacrificing the accuracy to some extent for computational efficiency by sampling the objective function. In this paper, we present a computationally effective approach for the direct minimization of a ranking objective function, without sampling. We demonstrate by experiments on the Y!Music and Netflix data sets that the proposed method outperforms other implicit feedback recommenders in many cases in terms of the ErrorRate, ARP and Recall evaluation metrics.

#! Digital music has experienced a quite fascinating transformation during the past decades. Thousands of people share or distribute their music collections on the Internet, resulting in an explosive increase of information and more user dependence on automatic recommender systems. Though there are many techniques such as collaborative filtering, most approaches focus mainly on users' global behaviors, neglecting local actions and the specific properties of music. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective local implicit feedback model mining users' local preferences to get better recommendation performance in both rating and ranking prediction. Moreover, we design an efficient training algorithm to speed up the updating procedure, and give a method to find the most appropriate time granularity to assist the performance. We conduct various experiments to evaluate the performance of this model, which show that it outperforms baseline model significantly. Integration with existing temporal models achieves a great improvement compared to the reported best single model for Yahoo! Music.

#! Most recommender systems assume user ratings accurately represent user preferences. However, prior research shows that user ratings are imperfect and noisy. Moreover, this noise limits the measurable predictive power of any recommender system. We propose an information theoretic framework for quantifying the preference information contained in ratings and predictions. We computationally explore the properties of our model and apply our framework to estimate the efficiency of different rating scales for real world datasets. We then estimate how the amount of information predictions give to users is related to the scale ratings are collected on. Our findings suggest a tradeoff in rating scale granularity: while previous research indicates that coarse scales (such as thumbs up / thumbs down) take less time, we find that ratings with these scales provide less predictive value to users. We introduce a new measure, preference bits per second, to quantitatively reconcile this tradeoff.

#! Traditional recommender systems are well established in scenarios in which "enough"items, users and ratings are available for the algorithms to operate on. However, automatic recommendations are also desirable in smaller online communities which only contain several hundred items and users. Collaborative filters, as one of the most successful technologies for recommender systems, do not perform well here. This paper argues that recommender systems can make use of contextual information and domain specific semantics in order to be able to generate recommendations also for these smaller usage scenarios. The new hybrid recommendation approach presented in the paper enhances traditional neighborhood-based collaborative filtering techniques through the use of new kinds of data and a combination of different recommendation methods (rule, demographic, and average based). While the algorithmic techniques presented in this paper are suitable (especially) for smaller online communities, they can also be applied to improve the quality of recommendations in larger communities. The approach was implemented and evaluated in a small regional bound parent education community. A multi-staged evaluation was conducted in order to determine the quality of recommendations: A cross-validation (recall), an expert questionnaire (recommendation quality) and a field study (user satisfaction). The results show that recommenders even for smaller communities are possible and can produce high quality recommendations.

#! Online hotel searching is a daunting task due to the wealth of online information. Reviews written by other travelers replace the word-of-mouth, yet turn the search into a time consuming task. Users do not rate enough hotels to enable a collaborative filtering based recommendation. Thus, a cold start recommender system is needed. In this work we design a cold start hotel recommender system, which uses the text of the reviews as its main data. We define context groups based on reviews extracted from TripAdvisor.com and Venere.com. We introduce a novel weighted algorithm for text mining. Our algorithm imitates a user that favors reviews written with the same trip intent and from people of similar background (nationality) and with similar preferences for hotel aspects, which are our defined context groups. Our approach combines numerous elements, including unsupervised clustering to build a vocabulary for hotel aspects, semantic analysis to understand sentiment towards hotel features, and the profiling of intent and nationality groups. We implemented our system which was used by the public to conduct 150 trip planning experiments. We compare our solution to the top suggestions of the mentioned web services and show that users were, on average, 20% more satisfied with our hotel recommendations. We outperform these web services even more in cities where hotel prices are high.

#! Probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) and other popular approaches to collaborative filtering assume that the ratings given by users for products are genuine, and hence they give equal importance to all available ratings. However, this is not always true due to several reasons including the presence of opinion spam in product reviews. In this paper, the possibility of performing collaborative filtering while attaching weights or quality scores to the ratings is explored. The quality scores, which are determined from the corresponding review data are used to "up-weight" or "down-weight" the importance given to the individual rating while performing collaborative filtering, thereby improving the accuracy of the predictions. First, the measure used to capture the quality of the ratings is described. Different approaches for estimating the quality score based on the available review information are examined. Subsequently, a mathematical formulation to incorporate quality scores as weights for the ratings in the basic PMF framework is derived. Experimental evaluation on two product categories of a benchmark data set from Amazon.com demonstrates the efficacy of our approach.

#! Contextual factors can greatly influence the users' preferences in listening to music. Although it is hard to capture these factors directly, it is possible to see their effects on the sequence of songs liked by the user in his/her current interaction with the system. In this paper, we present a context-aware music recommender system which infers contextual information based on the most recent sequence of songs liked by the user. Our approach mines the top frequent tags for songs from social tagging Web sites and uses topic modeling to determine a set of latent topics for each song, representing different contexts. Using a database of human-compiled playlists, each playlist is mapped into a sequence of topics and frequent sequential patterns are discovered among these topics. These patterns represent frequent sequences of transitions between the latent topics representing contexts. Given a sequence of songs in a user's current interaction, the discovered patterns are used to predict the next topic in the playlist. The predicted topics are then used to post-filter the initial ranking produced by a traditional recommendation algorithm. Our experimental evaluation suggests that our system can help produce better recommendations in comparison to a conventional recommender system based on collaborative or content-based filtering. Furthermore, the topic modeling approach proposed here is also useful in providing better insight into the underlying reasons for song selection and in applications such as playlist construction and context prediction.

#! In this paper we tackle the problem of recommendation in the scenarios with binary relevance data, when only a few (k) items are recommended to individual users. Past work on Collaborative Filtering (CF) has either not addressed the ranking problem for binary relevance datasets, or not specifically focused on improving top-k recommendations. To solve the problem we propose a new CF approach, Collaborative Less-is-More Filtering (CLiMF). In CLiMF the model parameters are learned by directly maximizing the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), which is a well-known information retrieval metric for measuring the performance of top-k recommendations. We achieve linear computational complexity by introducing a lower bound of the smoothed reciprocal rank metric. Experiments on two social network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and the scalability of CLiMF, and show that CLiMF significantly outperforms a naive baseline and two state-of-the-art CF methods.

#! The evaluation of recommender systems in terms of ranking has recently gained attention, as it seems to better fit the top-k recommendation task than the usual ratings prediction task. In that context, several authors have proposed to consider missing ratings as some form of negative feedback to compensate for the skewed distribution of observed ratings when users choose the items they rate. In this work, we study two major biases of the selection of items: the first one is that some items obtain more ratings than others (popularity effect), and the second one is that positive ratings are observed more frequently than negative ratings (positivity effect). We present a theoretical analysis and experiments on the Yahoo! dataset with randomly selected items, which show that considering missing data as a form of negative feedback during training may improve performances, but also that it can be misleading when testing, favoring models of popularity more than models of user preferences.

#! The increasing amount of side information associated with the items in E-commerce applications has provided a very rich source of information that, once properly exploited and incorporated, can significantly improve the performance of the conventional recommender systems. This paper focuses on developing effective algorithms that utilize item side information for top-N recommender systems. A set of sparse linear methods with side information (SSLIM) is proposed, which involve a regularized optimization process to learn a sparse aggregation coefficient matrix based on both user-item purchase profiles and item side information. This aggregation coefficient matrix is used within an item-based recommendation framework to generate recommendations for the users. Our experimental results demonstrate that SSLIM outperforms other methods in effectively utilizing side information and achieving performance improvement.

#! Similarity-based neighborhood methods, a simple and popular approach to collaborative filtering, infer their predictions by finding users with similar taste or items that have been similarly rated. If the number of users grows to millions, the standard approach of sequentially examining each item and looking at all interacting users does not scale. To solve this problem, we develop a MapReduce algorithm for the pairwise item comparison and top-N recommendation problem that scales linearly with respect to a growing number of users. This parallel algorithm is able to work on partitioned data and is general in that it supports a wide range of similarity measures. We evaluate our algorithm on a large dataset consisting of 700 million song ratings from Yahoo! Music.

#! A software developer programming in an object-oriented programming language deals with a source code structure that may contain hundreds of source code elements. These elements are commonly related to each other and working on a specific element may require the developer to access other related elements. We propose a recommendation approach that uses the context of the developer to retrieve and rank recommendations of relevant source code elements in the IDE. These recommendations provide a shortcut to reach the desired elements and increase the awareness of the developer in relation to elements that may be of interest in that moment. We have tested our approach with a group of developers and the results show that context has a promising role in predicting and ranking the source code elements needed by a developer at each moment.

#! In recent years, more and more images have been uploaded and published on the Web. Along with text Web pages, images have been becoming important media to place relevant advertisements. Visual contextual advertising, a young research area, refers to finding relevant text advertisements for a target image without any textual information (e.g., tags). There are two existing approaches, advertisement search based on image annotation, and more recently, advertisement matching based on feature translation between images and texts. However, the state of the art fails to achieve satisfactory results due to the fact that recommended advertisements are syntactically matched but semantically mismatched. In this paper, we propose a semantic approach to improving the performance of visual contextual advertising. More specifically, we exploit a large high-quality image knowledge base (ImageNet) and a widely-used text knowledge base (Wikipedia) to build a bridge between target images and advertisements. The image-advertisement match is built by mapping images and advertisements into the respective knowledge bases and then finding semantic matches between the two knowledge bases. The experimental results show that semantic match outperforms syntactic match significantly using test images from Flickr. We also show that our approach gives a large improvement of 16.4% on the precision of the top 10 matches over previous work, with more semantically relevant advertisements recommended.

#! Social-networking sites have started to offer tools that suggest "guests" who should be invited to user-defined social events (e.g., birthday parties, networking events). The problem of how to recommend people to events is similar to the more traditional (recommender system) problem of how to recommend events (items) to people (users). Yet, upon Foursquare data of "who visits what" in the city of London, we show that a state-of-the-art recommender system does not perform well -mainly because of data sparsity. To fix this problem, we add domain knowledge to the recommendation process. From the complex system literature in human mobility, we learn two insights: 1) there are special individuals (often called power users) who visit many places; and 2) individuals go to a venue not only because they like it but also because they are close-by. We model these insights into two simple models and learn that: 1) simply recommending power users works better than random but is far from producing the best recommendations; 2) an item-based recommender system produces accurate recommendations; and 3) recommending places that are closest to a user's geographic center of interest produces recommendations that are as accurate as, if not more accurate than, item-based recommender's. This last result has practical implications as it offers guidelines for designing location-based recommender systems and for partly addressing cold-start situations.

#! User demographics, such as age, gender and ethnicity, are routinely used for targeting content and advertising products to users. Similarly, recommender systems utilize user demographics for personalizing recommendations and overcoming the cold-start problem. Often, privacy-concerned users do not provide these details in their online profiles. In this work, we show that a recommender system can infer the gender of a user with high accuracy, based solely on the ratings provided by users (without additional metadata), and a relatively small number of users who share their demographics. Focusing on gender, we design techniques for effectively adding ratings to a user's profile for obfuscating the user's gender, while having an insignificant effect on the recommendations provided to that user.

#! The last ten years have seen a tremendous growth in Internet-based online services such as search, advertising, gaming and social networking. Today, it is important to analyze large collections of user interaction data as a first step in building predictive models for these services as well as learn these models in real-time. One of the biggest challenges in this setting is scale: not only does the sheer scale of data necessitate parallel processing but it also necessitates distributed models; with over 900 million active users at Facebook, any user-specific sets of features in a linear or non-linear model yields models of a size bigger than can be stored in a single system. In this talk, I will give a hands-on introduction to one of the most versatile tools for handling large collections of data with distributed probabilistic models: the sum-product algorithm for approximate message passing in factor graphs. I will discuss the application of this algorithm for the specific case of generalized linear models and outline the challenges of both approximate and distributed message passing including an in-depth discussion of expectation propagation and Map-Reduce.

#! This paper calls out several research challenges in the art of recommendation technology as applied in Web media sites. One particular characteristic of such recommendation settings is the relative low cost of falsely recommending an irrelevant item, which means that recommendation schemes can be less conservative and more exploratory. This also creates opportunities for better item cold-start handling. Other technical difficulties include analyzing offline data that is heavily biased by the site's appearance, and in a related vein -- once a recommendation module's appearance has been designed -- defining the correct metrics by which to measure it. Also called out are tradeoffs between personalization and contextualization, as are novel schemes that aim at recommending sets and sequences of items.

#! Media Websites often solicit users' comments on content items such as videos, news stories, blog posts, etc. Commenting activity increases user engagement with the sites, by both comment writers and readers, and so sites are looking for ways to increase the volume of comments. This work develops a recommender system aiming to present users with items -- news stories, in our case -- on which they are likely to comment. We combine items' content with a collaborative-filtering approach (utilizing users' co-commenting patterns) in a latent factor modeling framework. Building upon previous work, we focus on a continuous, real-time approach to address the problem above. After an initial training period during which commenting activity of users is observed, the system is tested at each subsequent comment submission event by predicting which story is being commented on by a given user at a given time. Our results show that we are able to overcome the site's inherent presentation bias and outperform a strong baseline as users' commenting history grows.

We frame this technique as a method for neighbour selection, and we show its effectiveness when compared with other cluster-based methods. Furthermore, the performance of our method could be improved if standard similarity metrics -- such as Pearson's correlation -- are also used when predicting the user's preferences.

#! Many recommendation systems rely on explicit ratings provided by their users. Often these ratings are provided long after consuming the item, relying heavily on people's representation of the quality of the item in memory. This paper investigates a psychological process, the "positivity effect", that influences the retrieval of quality judgments from our memory by which pleasant items are being processed and recalled from memory more effectively than unpleasant items. In an offline study on the MovieLens data we used the time between release date and rating date as a proxy for the time between consumption and rating. Ratings for movies tend to increase over time, consistent with the positivity effect. A subsequent online user study used a direct measure of time between rating and consumption, by asking users to rate movies (recently aired on television) and to explicitly report how long ago they watched these movies. In contrast to the offline study we find that ratings tend to decline over time showing reduced accuracy in ratings for items experienced long ago. We discuss the impact these rating dynamics might have on recommender algorithms, especially in cases where a new user has to submit his preferences to a system.

#! In the Recommendation Problem, it is often important to find a set of items similar to a particular item or a group of items. This problem of finding similar items for the recommendation task may also be viewed as a link prediction problem in a network, where the items can be treated as the nodes. The strength of the edge connecting two items represents the similarity between the items. In this context, a central challenge is to suitably define an appropriate dissimilarity function between the items. For content based recommender systems, the dissimilarity function should take into account the individual attributes of the items. The same attribute may have different importances in different parts of the underlying network. We focus on the problem of learning a suitable dissimilarity function between items and address it by formulating it as a constrained optimization problem which captures the local weightages of the attributes in different regions of the graph. The constraints are imposed in such a way that the non-connected nodes show higher value of dissimilarity than the connected nodes. The local tuning of the weights learns the optimal value of weights in various parts of the network: from the portions having rich graph information to the portions having only content information. Detailed experimentation shows the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the Adamic Adar metric as well as logistic regression methodology.

#! Though most recommender systems make suggestions for individual users, in many circumstances the selected items (e.g., movies) are not for personal usage but rather for consumption in group. In this paper, we present a recommender system for audio-visual content that generates suggestions for groups of people (such as families or friends) in the home environment. In this context, different group recommendation strategies are evaluated for various algorithms and sizes of the group. An offline evaluation proves the assumption that for randomly composed groups the accuracy of all recommendation algorithms decreases if the group size grows. Besides, the results show that the group recommendation strategy which produces the most accurate results is depending on the algorithm that is used for generating individual recommendations. Consequently, if an existing recommender system for individuals is extended to a recommender system for groups, the group recommendation strategy has to be chosen based on the utilized recommendation algorithm in order to maximize the efficiency of the group recommendations.

In this paper, we focus on the item prediction task of Recommender Systems and present SwarmRankCF, a method to automatically optimize the performance quality of recommender systems using a Swarm Intelligence perspective. Our approach, which is well-founded in a Particle Swarm Optimization framework, learns a ranking function by optimizing the combination of unique characteristics (i.e., features) of users, items and their interactions. In particular, we build feature vectors from a factorization of the user-item interaction matrix, and directly optimize Mean Average Precision metric in order to learn a linear ranking model for personalized recommendations. Our experimental evaluation, on a real world online radio dataset, indicates that our approach is able to find ranking functions that significantly improve the performance of the system for the Top-N recommendation task.

#! Hybrid recommender systems --- systems using multiple algorithms together to improve recommendation quality --- have been well-known for many years and have shown good performance in recent demonstrations such as the NetFlix Prize. Modern hybridization techniques, such as feature-weighted linear stacking, take advantage of the hypothesis that the relative performance of recommenders varies by circumstance and attempt to optimize each item score to maximize the strengths of the component recommenders. Less attention, however, has been paid to understanding what these strengths and failure modes are. Understanding what causes particular recommenders to fail will facilitate better selection of the component recommenders for future hybrid systems and a better understanding of how individual recommender personalities can be harnessed to improve the recommender user experience. We present an analysis of the predictions made by several well-known recommender algorithms on the MovieLens 10M data set, showing that for many cases in which one algorithm fails, there is another that will correctly predict the rating.

#! Transfer learning for collaborative filtering (TLCF) aims to solve the sparsity problem by transferring rating knowledge across multiple domains. Taking domain difference into ac- count, one of the issues in cross-domain collaborative filtering is to selectively transfer knowledge from source/auxiliary domains. In particular, this paper addresses the problem of inconstant users (users with changeable preferences across different domains) when transferring knowledge about users from another auxiliary domain. We first formulate the problem of inconstant users caused by domain difference and then propose a new model that performs constrained collective matrix factorization (CCMF). Our experiments on simulated and real data show that CCMF has superior performance than other methods.

#! The past decades have witnessed the rapid development of academic research, which results in a growing number of scholarly papers. As a result, paper recommender systems have been proposed to help researchers find their interested papers. Most previous studies in paper recommendations mainly concentrate on paper-paper or user-paper similarities without taking users' reading purposes into account. It is common that different users may prefer to different aspects of a paper, e.g., the focused problem/task or the proposed solution. In this paper, we propose to satisfy user-specific reading purposes by recommending the most problem-related papers or solution-related papers to users separately. For a target paper, we use the paper citation graph to generate a set of potential relevant papers. Once getting the candidate set, we calculate the problem-based similarities and solution-based similarities between candidates and the target paper through a concept based topic model, respectively. We evaluate our models on a real academic paper dataset and our experiments show that our approach outperforms a traditional similarity based model and can provide highly relevant paper recommendations according to different reading purposes for researchers.

#! In this paper, we present a systematic perspective study on choosing and evaluating the initial seed items that will be recommended to the cold start users. We first construct an item consumption correlation network to capture the existing users' general consumption behaviors. Then, we formalize initial items recommendation as the influential seed set selection problem. Along this line, we present several methods, each of which selects seed items according to different rules. Finally, the experimental results on two real-world data sets verify that with different seed items, the users' consumption numbers will be quite different. Meanwhile, the results also provide many deep insights into these selection methods and their recommended seed items.

#! Current approaches on collaborative filtering factorize user-item matrices in order to infer latent factors from ratings previously assigned by users. However, they all have to deal with sparseness, whose workarounds are prone to bias and/or overfitting. This paper proposes a recommender algorithm that is based on a factorized matrix composed of user preferences associated to the movies' genres/categories. The advantage of using such user-genre matrix factorization model is that it requires less computational resources, as the matrix will be less sparse and at lower dimension. We present the experimental results with a dataset composed of real users, comparing the performance of different modules of our algorithm.

#! In prior work we addressed a major problem faced by media sites with popularity based recommender systems such as the top-10 list of most liked or most clicked posts. We showed that the hard cutoff used in these systems to generate the "Top N"lists is prone to unduly penalizing good articles that may have just missed the cutoff. A solution to this was to generate recommendations probabilistically, which is an approach that has been shown to be robust against some manipulation techniques as well. The aim of this research is to introduce a class of probabilistic news recommender systems that incorporates widely practiced recommendation techniques as a special case. We establish our results in a special case of two articles using the urn models with feedback mechanism from probability theory.

The model allows us to learn from pairwise preference statements or from (incomplete) rankings over more than two items. We present two algorithms for performing inference in this model, both with excellent scaling in the number of users and items. The superior predictive performance of the new method is demonstrated on the well-known sushi preference data set. In addition, we show how the model can be used effectively in an active learning setting where we select only a small number of informative items for learning.

#! We present a microblog recommendation system that can help monitor users, track conversations, and potentially improve diffusion impact. Given a Twitter network of active users and their followers, and historical activity of tweets, retweets and mentions, we build upon a prediction tool to predict the Top K users who will retweet or mention a focal user, in the future [10]. We develop personalized recommendations for each focal user. We identify characteristics of focal users such as the size of the follower network, or the level of sentiment averaged over all tweets; both have an impact on the quality of personalized recommendations. We use (high) betweenness centrality as a proxy of attractive users to target when making recommendations. Our recommendations successfully identify a greater fraction of users with higher betweenness centrality, in comparison to the overall distribution of betweenness centrality of the ground truth users for some focal user.

#! Much work has been done to study the interplay between recommender systems and social networks. This creates a very powerful coupling in presenting highly relevant recommendations to the users. However, to our knowledge, little attention has been paid to leverage a user's social network to deliver these recommendations. We present a novel approach to aid delivery of recommendations using the recipient's friends or connections. Our contributions with this study are 1) A novel recommendation delivery paradigm called Social Referral, which utilizes a user's social network for the delivery of relevant content. 2) An implementation of the paradigm is described in a real industrial production setting of a large online professional network. 3) A study of the interaction between the trifecta of the recommender system, the trusted connections and the end consumer of the recommendation by comparing and contrasting the proposed approach's performance with the direct recommender system. Our experiments indicate that Social Referral is a promising mechanism for recommendation delivery. The experiments show that a significant portion of users are receptive to passing along relevant recommendations to their social networks, and that recommendations delivered through users' social networks are much more likely to be accepted than those directly delivered to users.

An on-line controlled experiment (A/B testing), conducted for one month and covering 600,000 distinct users, statistically points out to a general revenue increase in the order of 8-20%. In addition, other consumer behavior metrics such as the number of page views and the more diverse distribution of sales among the products catalog also support the positive impact of personalized recommendations in terms of business value.

We demonstrate how we weigh in among different recommendation algorithms and optimization methods. To enhance recommendation accuracy and handling time-sensitive questions, we propose a large scale real-time RS based on the combination of machine learning algorithms and the stream computing technology. Considering of algorithm flexibility and performance, we use the maximum entropy model as the fundamental model design in the CTR (click-through rate) prediction of recommendation items. In the perspective of the Enlister system architecture, we illustrate how we divide and conquer massive data processing problem with a novel stream computing design which reduces the data process latency down to seconds. Finally we analyze the online test result and prove our design concept by achieving a series of significant improvements.

#! With increased adoption of social networking tools, it is becoming more difficult to extract useful information from the mass of data generated daily by users. Curation of content and sources is an important filter in separating the signal from noise. A good set of credible sources often requires painstaking manual curation, which often yields incomplete coverage of a topic. In this demo, we present a recommender system to aid this process, improving the quality and quantity of sources. The system is highly-adaptable to the goals of the curator, enabling some novel uses for curating and monitoring lists of users.

The widespread adoption of mobile technology allows personalised applications to be deployed in an increasing host of contexts; user modelling, profiling, and personalised recommendations are becoming an integral component of mobile information systems. Furthermore, mobile technology enables the recording and collection of facets of daily life, which has given rise to the notion of the quantified self; researchers operating at the intersection of computer and social science are now seeking to understand how these mobiles' data can aide the design of health interventions and inform future psychological and social science research. In this work, we describe the design of a personalised mobile application that seeks user feedback and builds a user profile about people's gastrointestinal health using ratings and tags. We describe the application's design and the personalised health insights it provides (and, particularly, why recommendations were not designed as a means for self-diagnosis).

#! Online hotel searching is a daunting task due to the wealth of online information. Reviews written by other travelers replace the word-of-mouth, yet turn the search into a time consuming task. Users do not rate enough hotels to enable a collaborative filtering based recommendation. Thus, a cold start recommender system is needed. This demo describes briefly our cold start hotel recommender system, which uses the text of the reviews as its main data. We define context groups based on reviews extracted from TripAdvisor.com and Venere.com. We introduce a novel weighted algorithm for text mining. We implemented our system which was used by the public to conduct 150 trip planning experiments. We compare our solution to the top suggestions of the mentioned web services and show that users were, on average, 20% more satisfied with our hotel recommendations. We outperform these web services even more in cities where hotel prices are high.

In this demo, we will present the on- going development of a novel real-time search and discovery service named Yokie (http://yok.ie, early technology description originally published in [1]). Yokie uses the large volume of hyperlink-laden messages on social networks like Twitter as the basis of its content and ranking systems. Curated sets of users (or "Search Parties") form the basis of sourcing the content from the networks, and the metadata of the containing messages form the basis of ranking and contextual retrieval of the hyperlinks. Each hyperlink is in- dexed with a compound set of terms from multiple tweets (should the given hyperlink be shared more than once). This indexing step is a novel example of collaborative tagging of resources. The application is live with more than 100 users, who have performed approximately 1000 queries. We will demonstrate the main techniques and novel ranking and re- trieval techniques and user features.

#! Recommender systems help web users to address information overload. However their performance depends on the number of provided ratings by users. This problem is amplified for a new user because he/she has not provided any rating. To address this problem, active learning methods have been proposed to acquire those ratings from users, that will help most in determining their interests. However, different from the classic active learning, users (the "oracle") are not always able to provide an answer for queries. The easiest way to solve this problem is to ask most popular items, i.e items which have received many ratings from training users. But it is static and presents the same items to all users regardless of the ratings they have provided so far. In this paper we propose a method that improves the most popular selection strategy using the characteristics of matrix factorization. It finds similar users to the new user in the latent space and then selects item which is most popular among the similar users. The experimental results show the proposed method outperforms the most popular method both in terms of error and the number of received ratings.

We focus on two aspects of the context: temporal context and activity-based context and describe a more general personalisation framework based on lightweight semantics, that can leverage any type of context.

#! Real-world tagging datasets have a large proportion of new/unseen documents. Few approaches for recommending tags to a user for a document address this new item problem, concentrating instead on artificially created post-core datasets where it is guaranteed that the user as well as the document of each test post is known to the system and already has some tags assigned to it. In order to recommend tags for unseen documents, approaches are required which model documents not only based on the tags assigned to it in the past (if any), but also the content. The focus of my research is on utilising the content of documents in order to address the new item problem in tag recommendation. I apply this methodology first to simple baseline tag recommenders and then the more advanced tag recommendation algorithm FolkRank. One of my main contributions is a novel adaptation to the FolkRank graph model to use multiple word nodes instead of a single document node to represent each document. This enables FolkRank to recommend tags for unseen documents and makes it applicable to full real-world tagging datasets, addressing the new item problem in tag recommendation.

In this paper, I survey visual approaches that go beyond presenting the recommended items as a textual list or as annotations in context. I also review related literature from recommendations' explanations. In this thesis, I aim to understand how different visualizations and some personal traits might influence users' assessment of recommended items, particularly in domains where multidimensional data or contextual constraints are involved. I present the prototype of 2 recommendation visualizations and then briefly propose the research approach of this investigation.

This paper describes a user-centered approach, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative methods, which aims to establish how and why users engage with library catalogues and WorldCat.org in particular, whether there is a need for recommendations in the library domain, and if so what type of recommendations best support the information-seeking needs of users. An outline of the proposed methodology is provided, along with a report on work completed to date. An analysis of UK library catalogues shows the prevalence of recommender systems to be very low, while initial results from focus group interviews and a pop-up survey show a significant demand for recommendations from two key user-groups (students and academics).

#! Our work focuses on the improvement of the accuracy of context-aware recommender systems. Contextual information showed to be promising factor in recommender systems. However, pure context-based recommender systems can not outperform other approaches mainly due to high sparsity of contextual information. We propose an idea to improve accuracy of context based recommender systems by context inference. Context inference is based on effect discovered by analyses of the context as a factor influencing user needs. Analyses of the news readers reveals existence of behavioural correlation which is the main pillar of proposed context inference. Method for context inference is based on collaborative filtering and clustering of web usage (as a non-discretizing alternative to association rules mining).

#! Interacting with a recommender system means to take different decisions such as selecting an item from a recommendation list, selecting a specific item feature value (e.g., camera's size, zoom) as a search criteria, selecting feedback features to be critiqued in a critiquing based recommendation session, or selecting a repair proposal for inconsistent user preferences when interacting with a knowledge-based recommender. In all these situations, users face a decision task. This workshop (Decisions@RecSys) focuses on approaches for supporting effective and efficient human decision making in different types of recommendation scenarios.

#! Measuring the error in rating prediction has been by far the dominant evaluation methodology in the Recommender Systems literature. Yet there seems to be a general consensus that this criterion alone is far from being enough to assess the practical effectiveness of a recommender system. Information Retrieval metrics have started to be used to evaluate item selection and ranking rather than rating prediction, but considerable divergence remains in the adoption of such metrics by different authors. On the other hand, recommendation utility includes other key dimensions and concerns beyond accuracy, such as novelty and diversity, user engagement, and business performance. While the need for further extension, formalization, clarification and standardization of evaluation methodologies is recognized in the community, this need is still unmet for a large extent. The RUE 2012 workshop sought to identify and better understand the current gaps in recommender system evaluation methodologies, help lay directions for progress in addressing them, and contribute to the consolidation and convergence of experimental methods and practice.

Surprisingly however, research addressing user perceptions of local recommendations and local differences when interacting with such recommendation services is yet scarce. Location-based recommendation services are mostly evaluated from a `recommendation systems' standpoint, with limited experiential insights from users and limited focus on local differences that may apply. This workshop focuses on the local, personal user experience, and provides a forum to exchange experiences, insights and strategies in personalizing local mobile applications and generating local recommendations that fit local user needs.

#! It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 7th ACM Recommender Systems Conference (ACM RecSys 2013), held in Hong Kong on October 12-16. As RecSys enters the second half of its first decade, it has clearly established itself as the premier international venue for research and development in the field of Recommender Systems, where leading researchers and practitioners from around the world meet and discuss their latest results and solutions. The growing prestige of the conference is reflected by the significant increase in the number of papers that were submitted to the technical program. The overall number of paper submissions went up 20% as compared to last year, with a total of 222 submissions. We received 136 full paper submissions, from which 32 were accepted (23.5%) for oral presentation and 18 were accepted as short papers and poster presentations. We received 80 short paper submissions, from which 24 were accepted (28.75%). Seven of these short papers were selected for short oral presentation and the remaining for poster presentation. For the first time this year, in addition to full and short papers, we also had a new category of submissions consisting of full-length industry papers. We received six papers in this category, out of which two papers were accepted and were presented during the industrial research session. To accommodate the large number of high-quality papers that we received and accepted, the number of research sessions has been increased to eight from the previous year's five sessions. Besides the technical program, the conference's overall program also includes tutorials, workshops, a doctoral symposium, and demonstrations. The tutorial program includes four exciting tutorials covering state-of-the-art methods for building recommender systems and emerging application areas. The workshop program includes eight different one-day workshops that take place the two days prior to the main conference. The doctoral symposium showcases the work of six PhD students, whose work has been selected after a rigorous review process. Finally, the demonstration program contains five different demonstrations covering various aspects of recommender systems. The conference program also includes three keynotes, one from an academic perspective by Oren Etzioni (University of Washington) and two from an industrial perspective by Dou Shen (Baidu) and Mu Yan (Beihe). Finally, continuing with the tradition of the conference, there is a strong integration of the research with its commercial applications. This is reflected through the strong participation of industry at the workshops, demonstrations, and technical program, as well as a special industrial session containing presentations of the accepted industry papers, invited talks, and panel discussions.

#! In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian approach for personalized recommendations. In our approach, we model both user preferences and items under recommendation as multivariate Gaussian distributions; and make use of Normal-Inverse Wishart priors to model the recommendation agent beliefs about user types. We employ a lightweight agent-user interaction process, during which the user is presented with and asked to rate a small number of items. We then interpret these ratings in an innovative way, using them to guide a Bayesian updating process that helps us both capture a user's current mood, and maintain her overall user type. We produced several variants of our approach, and applied them in the movie recommendations domain, evaluating them on data from the MovieLens dataset. Our algorithms are shown to be competitive against a state-of-the-art method, which nevertheless requires a minimum set of ratings from various users to provide recommendations---unlike our entirely personalized approach.

#! One important challenge of current search engines is to satisfy the users' needs when they provide a poorly formulated query. When the pages matching the user's original keywords are judged to be unsatisfactory, query recommendation techniques are used to propose alternative queries and alter the result set. These techniques search for queries that are semantically similar to the user's original query, often searching for keywords that are similar to the keywords given by the user. However, when the original query is sufficiently ill-posed, the user's informational need is best met using entirely different keywords, and a substantially different query may be necessary. We propose a novel approach that is not based on the keywords of the original query. We intentionally seek out orthogonal queries, which are related queries that have (almost) no common terms with the user's query. This allows an orthogonal query to satisfy the user's informational need when small perturbations of the original keyword set are insufficient. By using this technique to generate query recommendations, we outperform several known approaches, being the best for long tail queries.

#! The literature on recommender systems distinguishes typically between two broad categories of measuring recommendation accuracy: rating prediction, often quantified in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE), and ranking, measured in terms of metrics like precision and recall, among others. In this paper, we examine both approaches in detail, and find that the dominating difference lies instead in the training and test data considered: rating prediction is concerned with only the observed ratings, while ranking typically accounts for all items in the collection, whether the user has rated them or not. Furthermore, we show that predicting observed ratings, while popular in the literature, only solves a (small) part of the rating prediction task for any item in the collection, which is a common real-world problem. The reasons are selection bias in the data, combined with data sparsity. We show that the latter rating-prediction task involves the prediction task 'Who rated What' as a sub-problem, which can be cast as a classification or ranking problem. This suggests that solving the ranking problem is not only valuable by itself, but also for predicting the rating value of any item.

In contrast to search-based approaches, critiquing-based recommender systems provide a navigation-based interface where users are enabled to critique displayed recommendations as a means of preference elicitation. In this paper we present Recomment, our approach to natural language based unit critiquing. We discuss the developed prototype and present the corresponding user interface. In order to show the applicability of our concepts, we present the results of a user study. This study shows that speech interfaces have the potential to improve the perceived ease of use as well as the overall quality of recommendations.

#! Traditional recommender systems minimize prediction error with respect to users' choices. Recent studies have shown that recommender systems have a positive effect on the provider's revenue. In this paper we show that by providing a set of recommendations different than the one perceived best according to user acceptance rate, the recommendation system can further increase the business' utility (e.g. revenue), without any significant drop in user satisfaction. Indeed, the recommendation system designer should have in mind both the user, whose taste we need to reveal, and the business, which wants to promote specific content. We performed a large body of experiments comparing a commercial state-of-the-art recommendation engine with a modified recommendation list, which takes into account the utility (or revenue) which the business obtains from each suggestion that is accepted by the user. We show that the modified recommendation list is more desirable for the business, as the end result gives the business a higher utility (or revenue). To study possible reduce in satisfaction by providing the user worse suggestions, we asked the users how they perceive the list of recommendation that they received. Differences in user satisfaction between the lists is negligible, and not statistically significant. We also uncover a phenomenon where movie consumers prefer watching and even paying for movies that they have already seen in the past than movies that are new to them.

#! In order to recommend products to users we must ultimately predict how a user will respond to a new product. To do so we must uncover the implicit tastes of each user as well as the properties of each product. For example, in order to predict whether a user will enjoy Harry Potter, it helps to identify that the book is about wizards, as well as the user's level of interest in wizardry. User feedback is required to discover these latent product and user dimensions. Such feedback often comes in the form of a numeric rating accompanied by review text. However, traditional methods often discard review text, which makes user and product latent dimensions difficult to interpret, since they ignore the very text that justifies a user's rating. In this paper, we aim to combine latent rating dimensions (such as those of latent-factor recommender systems) with latent review topics (such as those learned by topic models like LDA). Our approach has several advantages. Firstly, we obtain highly interpretable textual labels for latent rating dimensions, which helps us to `justify' ratings with text. Secondly, our approach more accurately predicts product ratings by harnessing the information present in review text; this is especially true for new products and users, who may have too few ratings to model their latent factors, yet may still provide substantial information from the text of even a single review. Thirdly, our discovered topics can be used to facilitate other tasks such as automated genre discovery, and to identify useful and representative reviews.

#! Matrix factorization is known to be an effective method for recommender systems that are given only the ratings from users to items. Currently, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is one of the most popular algorithms for matrix factorization. However, as a sequential approach, SGD is difficult to be parallelized for handling web-scale problems. In this paper, we develop a fast parallel SGD method, FPSGD, for shared memory systems. By dramatically reducing the cache-miss rate and carefully addressing the load balance of threads, FPSGD is more efficient than state-of-the-art parallel algorithms for matrix factorization.

#! Improving recommendation accuracy is the mostly focused target of recommendation systems, while it has been increasingly recognized that accuracy is not enough as the only quality criterion. More concepts have been proposed recently to augment the evaluation dimensions, such as similarity, diversity, long-tail, etc. Simultaneously considering multiple criteria leads to a multi-task recommendation. In this paper, a graph-based recommendation approach is proposed to effectively and flexibly trade-off among them. Our approach is considered based a 1st order Markovian graph with transition probabilities between user-item pairs. A "cost flow" concept is proposed over the graph, so that items with lower costs are stronger recommended to a user. The cost flows are formulated in a recursive dynamic form, whose stability is proved to be guaranteed by appropriately lower-bounding the transition costs. Furthermore, a mixture of transition costs is designed by combining three ingredients related to long-tail, focusing degree and similarity. To evaluate the ingredients, we propose an orthogonal-sparse-orthogonal nonnegative matrix tri-factorization model and an efficient multiplicative algorithm. Empirical experiments on real-world data show promising results of our approach, which could be regarded as a general framework for other affects if transition costs are designed in various ways.

#! The proliferation of online news creates a need for filtering interesting articles. Compared to other products, however, recommending news has specific challenges: news preferences are subject to trends, users do not want to see multiple articles with similar content, and frequently we have insufficient information to profile the reader. In this paper, we introduce a class of news recommendation systems based on context trees. They can provide high-quality news recommendations to anonymous visitors based on present browsing behaviour. Using an unbiased testing methodology, we show that they make accurate and novel recommendations, and that they are sufficiently flexible for the challenges of news recommendation.

#! Personalization techniques have been widely adopted in many recommender systems. However, experiments on real-world datasets show that for some users in certain contexts, personalized recommendations do not necessarily perform better than recommendations that rely purely on popularity. Broadly, this can be interpreted by the fact that the parameters of a personalization model are usually estimated from sparse data; the resulting personalized prediction, despite of its low bias, is often volatile. In this paper, we study the problem further by investigating into the ranking of recommendation lists. From a risk management and portfolio retrieval perspective, there is no difference between the popularity-based and the personalized ranking as both of the recommendation outputs can be represented as the trade-off between expected relevance (reward) and associated uncertainty (risk). Through our analysis, we discover common scenarios and provide a technique to predict whether personalization will fail. Besides the theoretical understanding, our experimental results show that the resulting switch algorithm, which decides whether or not to personalize, outperforms the mainstream recommendation algorithms.

#! We present a matrix factorization model inspired by challenges we encountered while working on the Xbox movies recommendation system. The item catalog in a recommender system is typically equipped with meta-data features in the form of labels. However, only part of these features are informative or useful with regard to collaborative filtering. By incorporating a novel sparsity prior on feature parameters, the model automatically discerns and utilizes informative features while simultaneously pruning non-informative features. The model is designed for binary feedback, which is common in many real-world systems where numeric rating data is scarce or non-existent. However, the overall framework is applicable to any likelihood function. Model parameters are estimated with a Variational Bayes inference algorithm, which is robust to over-fitting and does not require cross-validation and fine tuning of regularization coefficients. The efficacy of our method is illustrated on a sample from the Xbox movies dataset as well as on the publicly available MovieLens dataset. In both cases, the proposed solution provides superior predictive accuracy, especially for long-tail items. We then demonstrate the feature selection capabilities and compare against the common case of simple Gaussian priors. Finally, we show that even without features, our model performs better than a baseline model trained with the popular stochastic gradient descent approach.

#! We study the problem of optimizing recommendation systems for e-commerce sites. We consider in particular a combinatorial solution to this optimization based on the well known Maximum Coverage problem that asks for the k sets (products) that cover the most elements from a ground set (consumers). This formulation provides an abstract model for what k products should be recommended to maximize the probability of consumer purchase. Unfortunately, Maximum Coverage is NP-complete but an efficient approximation algorithm exists based on the Greedy methodology. We exhibit test results from the Greedy method on real data sets showing 3-8% increase in sales using the Maximum Coverage optimization method in comparison to the standard best-seller list. A secondary effect that our Greedy algorithm exhibits on the tested data is increased diversification in presented products over the best-seller list.

#! E-commerce companies are increasingly encouraging their users to connect to social media venues such as Facebook and Pinterest. The main strategic goal of such social connections is to boost user interaction and adoption on social media. However only a few efforts have been focused so far on leveraging users' social profiles to personalize the e-commerce experience and to recommend products of interest. In this paper, we start exploring this topic by investigating if a user's social media profile can be used to predict and recommend what type of products and what brands the social user is more likely to buy. More specifically, we study the correlation between the brands liked by the user on social media sites and those purchased on an e-commerce site. We then leverage these correlations in a brand prediction system, showing that social media can be effectively used to recommend branded products when user-user collaborative filtering techniques are used.

#! An ever increasing number of social services offer thousands of diverse events per day. Users tend to be overwhelmed by the massive amount of information available, especially with limited browsing options perceived in many event web services. To alleviate this information overload, a recommender system becomes a vital component for assisting users selecting relevant events. However, such system faces a number of challenges owed to the the inherent complex nature of an event. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach built on top of Semantic Web. On the one hand, we use a content-based system enriched with Linked Data to overcome the data sparsity, a problem induced by the transiency of events. On the other hand, we incorporate a collaborative filtering to involve the social aspect, an influential feature in decision making. This hybrid system is enhanced by the integration of a user diversity model designed to detect user propensity towards specific topics. We show how the hybridization of CB+CF systems and the integration of interest diversity features are important to improve predictions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using precision and recall measures.

#! The advent of the Linked Open Data (LOD) initiative gave birth to a variety of open knowledge bases freely accessible on the Web. They provide a valuable source of information that can improve conventional recommender systems, if properly exploited. In this paper we present SPrank, a novel hybrid recommendation algorithm able to compute top-N item recommendations from implicit feedback exploiting the information available in the so called Web of Data. We leverage DBpedia, a well-known knowledge base in the LOD compass, to extract semantic path-based features and to eventually compute recommendations using a learning to rank algorithm. Experiments with datasets on two different domains show that the proposed approach outperforms in terms of prediction accuracy several state-of-the-art top-N recommendation algorithms for implicit feedback in situations affected by different degrees of data sparsity.

#! Random walks on graphs are a staple of many ranking and recommendation algorithms. Simulating random walks on a graph which fits in memory is trivial, but massive graphs pose a problem: the latency of following walks across network in a cluster or loading nodes from disk on-demand renders basic random walk simulation unbearably inefficient. In this work we propose DrunkardMob, a new algorithm for simulating hundreds of millions, or even billions, of random walks on massive graphs, on just a single PC or laptop. Instead of simulating one walk a time it processes millions of them in parallel, in a batch. Based on DrunkardMob and GraphChi we further propose a framework for easily expressing scalable algorithms based on graph walks.

#! Mobile networks enable users to post on social media services (e.g., Twitter) from anywhere. The activities of mobile users involve three major entities: user, post, and location. The interaction of these entities is the key to answer questions such as who will post a message where and on what topic? In this paper, we address the problem of profiling mobile users by modeling their activities, i.e., we explore topic modeling considering the spatial and textual aspects of user posts, and predict future user locations. We propose the first ST (Spatial Topic) model to capture the correlation between users' movements and between user interests and the function of locations. We employ the sparse coding technique which greatly speeds up the learning process. We perform experiments on two real life data sets from Twitter and Yelp. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model consistently improves the average precision@1,5,10,15,20 for location recommendation by at least 50% (Twitter) and 300% (Yelp) against existing state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms and geographical topic models.

#! Many online systems present a list of recommendations and infer user interests implicitly from clicks or other contextual actions. For modeling user feedback in such settings, a common approach is to consider items acted upon to be relevant to the user, and irrelevant otherwise. However, clicking some but not others conveys an implicit ordering of the presented items. Pairwise learning, which leverages such implicit ordering between a pair of items, has been successful in areas such as search ranking. In this work, we study whether pairwise learning can improve community recommendation. We first present two novel pairwise models adapted from logistic regression. Both offline and online experiments in a large real-world setting show that incorporating pairwise learning improves the recommendation performance. However, the improvement is only slight. We find that users' preferences regarding the kinds of communities they like can differ greatly, which adversely affect the effectiveness of features derived from pairwise comparisons. We therefore propose a probabilistic latent semantic indexing model for pairwise learning (Pairwise PLSI), which assumes a set of users' latent preferences between pairs of items. Our experiments show favorable results for the Pairwise PLSI model and point to the potential of using pairwise learning for community recommendation.

#! Traditional batch model-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) approaches typically assume a collection of users' rating data is given a priori for training the model. They suffer from a common yet critical drawback, i.e., the model has to be re-trained completely from scratch whenever new training data arrives, which is clearly non-scalable for large real recommender systems where users' rating data often arrives sequentially and frequently. In this paper, we investigate a novel efficient and scalable online collaborative filtering technique for on-the-fly recommender systems, which is able to effectively online update the recommendation model from a sequence of rating observations. Specifically, we propose a family of online multi-task collaborative filtering (OMTCF) algorithms, which tackle the online collaborative filtering task by exploiting the similar principle as online multitask learning. Encouraging empirical results on large-scale datasets showed that the proposed technique is significantly more effective than the state-of-the-art algorithms.

#! Many Internet users have encountered serious information overload problem on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, where users can consume the streams of social updates from their social connections. Traditional methods solving this problem include collaborative filtering and information diffusion modeling. Both methods answer the "who will adopt what" question from different perspective, while either of them only captures single-faceted knowledge of evidences. In this paper, we solve the personalized social update recommendation problem by proposing a framework which integrates the advantages of collaborative filtering and the characteristics of diffusion processes. The main contributions of this paper are three folds. First, we propose a plenty of diffusion features which capture the characteristics of diffusion processes. Second, we build a joint model which takes the advantages of both collaborative filtering and the characteristics of diffusion processes for recommendation. Finally, experiments on two real-world datasets show that our joint model outperforms the methods capturing single-faceted knowledge and several other baselines.

#! Matrix factorization techniques such as the singular value decomposition (SVD) have had great success in recommender systems. We present a new perspective of SVD for constructing a latent space from the training data, which is justified by the theory of hypergraph model. We show that the vectors representing the items in the latent space can be grouped into (approximately) orthogonal clusters which correspond to the vertex clusters in the co-rating hypergraph, and the lengths of the vectors are indicators of the representativeness of the items. These properties are used for making top-$N$ recommendations in a two-phase algorithm. In this work, we provide a new explanation for the significantly better performance of the asymmetric SVD approaches and a novel algorithm for better diversity in top-N recommendations.

#! This paper explores a method for incorporating into a recommender system explicit representations of user's preferences over non-content attributes such as popularity, recency, and similarity of recommended items. We show how such attributes can be modeled as a preference vector that can be used in a vector-space content-based recommender, and how that content-based recommender can be integrated with various collaborative filtering techniques through re-weighting of Top-M recommendations. We evaluate this approach on several recommender systems datasets and collaborative filtering methods, and find that incorporating the three preference attributes can lead to a substantial increase in Top-50 precision while also enhancing diversity and novelty.

#! We propose a novel approach to context-aware music recommendation - recommending music suited for places of interest (POIs). The suggested hybrid approach combines two techniques -- one based on representing both POIs and music with tags, and the other based on the knowledge of the semantic relations between the two types of items. We show that our approach can be scaled up using a novel music auto-tagging technique and we compare it in a live user study to: two non-hybrid solutions, either based on tags or on semantic relations; and to a context-free but personalized recommendation approach. In the considered scenario, i.e., a situation defined by a context (the POI), we show that personalization (via music preference) is not sufficient and it is important to implement effective adaptation techniques to the user's context. In fact, we show that the users are more satisfied with the recommendations generated by combining the tag-based and knowledge-based context adaptation techniques, which exploit orthogonal types of relations between places and music tracks.

#! Finding books that children/teenagers are interested in these days is a non-trivial task due to the diversity of topics covered in huge volumes of books with varied readability levels. Even though K-12 readers can turn to book recommenders to look for books, the recommended books may not satisfy their personal needs, since they could be beyond/below their readability levels or fail to match their topics of interest. To address these problems, we introduce BReK12, a book recommender that makes personalized suggestions tailored to each K-12 user U based on books available on a social book-marking site that (i) are similar in content to the ones that are known to be of interest to U, (ii) have been bookmarked by users with reading patterns similar to U's, and (iii) can be comprehended by U. BReK12 is an asset to its users, since it suggests books that are appealing to its users and at grade levels that they can cope with, which can increase their reading selection choices and motivate them to read. We have also developed ReLAT, the readability analysis tool employed by BReK12 to determine the grade level of books. ReLAT is novel, compared with existing readability formulas, since it can predict the grade level of a book even if an excerpt of the book is not available. We have conducted empirical studies which have verified the accuracy of ReLAT in predicting the grade level of a book and the effectiveness of BReK12 over existing baseline recommendation systems.

#! Location-based social networks (LBSNs) have attracted an inordinate number of users and greatly enriched the urban experience in recent years. The availability of spatial, temporal and social information in online LBSNs offers an unprecedented opportunity to study various aspects of human behavior, and enable a variety of location-based services such as location recommendation. Previous work studied spatial and social influences on location recommendation in LBSNs. Due to the strong correlations between a user's check-in time and the corresponding check-in location, recommender systems designed for location recommendation inevitably need to consider temporal effects. In this paper, we introduce a novel location recommendation framework, based on the temporal properties of user movement observed from a real-world LBSN dataset. The experimental results exhibit the significance of temporal patterns in explaining user behavior, and demonstrate their power to improve location recommendation performance.

#! Online reviews play a vital role in the decision-making process for online users. Helpful reviews are usually buried in a large number of unhelpful reviews, and with the consistently increasing number of reviews, it becomes more and more difficult for online users to find helpful reviews. Therefore most online review websites allow online users to rate the helpfulness of a review and a global helpfulness score is computed for the review based on its available ratings. However, in reality, user-specified helpfulness ratings for reviews are very sparse - a few reviews attract large numbers of helpfulness ratings while most reviews obtain few or even no helpfulness ratings. The available helpfulness ratings are too sparse for online users to assess the helpfulness of reviews. Also the helpfulness of a review is not necessarily equally useful for all users and users with different background may treat the helpfulness of a review very differently. The user idiosyncracy of review helpfulness motivates us to study the problem of review helpfulness rating prediction in this paper. We first identify various types of context information, model them mathematically, and propose a context-aware review helpfulness rating prediction framework CAP. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the importance of context awareness in solving the review helpfulness rating prediction problem.

#! Tag recommendation approaches have historically focused on maximizing the relevance of the recommended tags for a given object, such as a movie or a song. Nevertheless, different users may be interested in the same object for different reasons---for instance, the Star Wars movies may appeal to both adventure as well as to fantasy movie fans. In this situation, a sensible strategy is to provide a user with diverse recommendations of how to tag the object. In this paper, we address the problem of recommending relevant and diverse tags as a ranking problem. In particular, we propose a novel tag recommendation approach that explicitly takes into account the possible topics (e.g., categories) underlying an object in order to promote tags with high coverage and low redundancy with respect to these topics. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed approach using data collected from two popular Web 2.0 applications, namely, LastFM and MovieLens. Our experimental results attest the effectiveness of our approach at promoting more relevant and diverse tags in contrast to state-of-the-art relevance-based methods as well as a recently proposed method that takes both relevance and diversity into account.

#! This paper introduces retargeted matrix factorization (R-MF); a novel approach for learning the user-wise ranking of items in the context of collaborative filtering. R-MF learns to rank by "retargeting" the item ratings of each user, searching for a monotonic transformation of the ratings that results in a better fit while preserving the ranked order of each user's ratings. The retargeting is combined with an underlying matrix factorization regression model that couples the user-wise rankings to exploit shared low dimensional structure. We show that R-MF recovers a unique solution under mild conditions, and propose a simple and efficient optimization scheme that alternates between retargeting the ratings subject to ordering constraints, and matrix factorization regression. The retargeting step is independent for each user, and is trivially parallelized. The ranking performance of retargeted matrix factorization is evaluated on benchmark movie recommendation datasets and results in superior ranking performance compared to collaborative filtering algorithms specifically designed to optimize ranking metrics.

#! The application a smart phone user will launch next intuitively depends on the sequence of apps used recently. More generally, when users interact with systems such as shopping websites or online radio, they click on items that are of interest in the current context. We call the sequence of clicks made in the current session interactional context. It is desirable for a recommender system to use the context set by the user to update recommendations. Most current context-aware recommender systems focus on a relatively less dynamic representational context defined by attributes such as season, location and tastes. In this paper, we study the problem of collaborative filtering with interactional context, where the goal is to make personalized and dynamic recommendations to a user engaged in a session. To this end, we propose the methodname algorithm that works in two stages. First, users are clustered by their transition behavior (one-step Markov transition probabilities between items), and cluster-level Markov models are computed. Then personalized PageRank is computed for a given user on the corresponding cluster Markov graph, with a personalization vector derived from the current context. We give an interpretation of the second stage of the algorithm as adding an appropriate context bias, in addition to click bias (or rating bias), to a classical neighborhood-based collaborative filtering model, where the neighborhood is determined from a Markov graph. Experimental results on two real-life datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm, where we achieve at least 20% (up to 37%) improvement over competitive methods in the recall level at top-20.

#! Context aware recommender systems go beyond the traditional personalized recommendation models by incorporating a form of situational awareness. They provide recommendations that not only correspond to a user's preference profile, but that are also tailored to a given situation or context. We consider the setting in which contextual information is represented as a subset of an item feature space describing short-term interests or needs of a user in a given situation. This contextual information can be provided by the user in the form of an explicit query, or derived implicitly. We propose a unified probabilistic model that integrates user profiles, item representations, and contextual information. The resulting recommendation framework computes the conditional probability of each item given the user profile and the additional context. These probabilities are used as recommendation scores for ranking items. Our model is an extension of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model that provides the capability for joint modeling of users, items, and the meta-data associated with contexts. Each user profile is modeled as a mixture of the latent topics. The discovered latent topics enable our system to handle missing data in item features. We demonstrate the application of our framework for article and music recommendation. In the latter case, the set of popular tags from social tagging Web sites are used for context descriptions. Our evaluation results show that considering context can help improve the quality of recommendations.

#! One of the challenges for recommender systems is that users struggle to accurately map their internal preferences to external measures of quality such as ratings. We study two methods for supporting the mapping process: (i) reminding the user of characteristics of items by providing personalized tags and (ii) relating rating decisions to prior rating decisions using exemplars. In our study, we introduce interfaces that provide these methods of support. We also present a set of methodologies to evaluate the efficacy of the new interfaces via a user experiment. Our results suggest that presenting exemplars during the rating process helps users rate more consistently, and increases the quality of the data.

#! We present a simple and scalable algorithm for top-N recommendation able to deal with very large datasets and (binary rated) implicit feedback. We focus on memory-based collaborative filtering algorithms similar to the well known neighboor based technique for explicit feedback. The major difference, that makes the algorithm particularly scalable, is that it uses positive feedback only and no explicit computation of the complete (user-by-user or item-by-item) similarity matrix needs to be performed. The study of the proposed algorithm has been conducted on data from the Million Songs Dataset (MSD) challenge whose task was to suggest a set of songs (out of more than 380k available songs) to more than 100k users given half of the user listening history and complete listening history of other 1 million people. In particular, we investigate on the entire recommendation pipeline, starting from the definition of suitable similarity and scoring functions and suggestions on how to aggregate multiple ranking strategies to define the overall recommendation. The technique we are proposing extends and improves the one that already won the MSD challenge last year.

#! We present techniques to characterize which data contributes most to the accuracy of a recommendation algorithm. Our main technique is called differential data analysis. The name is inspired by other sorts of differential analysis, such as differential power analysis and differential cryptanalysis, where insight comes through analysis of slightly differing inputs. In differential data analysis we chunk the data and compare results in the presence or absence of each chunk. We apply differential data analysis to two datasets and three different attributes. The first attribute is called user hardship. This is a novel attribute, particularly relevant to location datasets, that indicates how burdensome a data point was to achieve. The second and third attributes are more standard: timestamp and user rating. For user rating, we confirm previous work concerning the increased importance to the recommender of high and low user ratings.

These models have shown to achieve state-of-the-art retrieval performance in the pseudo relevance feedback task. In this paper we propose a novel adaptation of this language modeling approach to rating-based Collaborative Filtering. In a memory-based approach, we apply the model to the formation of user neighbourhoods, and the generation of recommendations based on such neighbourhoods. We report experimental results where our method outperforms other standard memory-based algorithms in terms of ranking precision.

#! This paper presents a set of algorithms used for music recommendations and personalization in a general purpose social network www.ok.ru, the second largest social network in the CIS visited by more then 40 millions users per day. In addition to classical recommendation features like "recommend a sequence" and "find similar items" the paper describes novel algorithms for construction of context aware recommendations, personalization of the service, handling of the cold-start problem, and more. All algorithms described in the paper are working on-line and are able to detect and address changes in the user's behavior and needs in the real time. The core component of the algorithms is a taste graph containing information about different entities (users, tracks, artists, etc.) and relations between them (for example, user A likes song B with certainty X, track B created by artist C, artist C is similar to artist D with certainty Y and so on). Using the graph it is possible to select tracks a user would most probably like, to arrange them in a way that they match each other well, to estimate which items from a fixed list are most relevant for the user, and more. In addition, the paper describes the approach used to estimate algorithms efficiency and analyze the impact of different recommendation related features on the users' behavior and overall activity at the service.

#! When humans face a broad spectrum of topics, where each topic consists of several options, they usually make a decision on each topic separately. Usually, a person will perform better by making a global decision, however, taking all consequences into account is extremely difficult. We present a novel computational method for advice-generation in an environment where people need to decide among multiple selection problems. This method is based on the prospect theory and uses machine learning techniques. We graphically present this advice to the users and compare it with advice which encourages the users to always select the option with a higher expected outcome. We show that our method outperforms the expected outcome approach in terms of user and satisfaction.

#! In a social network, users can sort members of their social graph into friend lists to both understand the social structures within the graph and control the flow of incoming and outgoing information. To reduce the user-effort required to create these lists, previous work has developed techniques for generating friend-lists in a static social graph. This paper considers the user effort required to create friend lists in an evolving graph. We have developed several new initial quantitative metrics to capture this effort, and identified an initial technique for modeling graph growth. We have used these metrics and model to compare two techniques for evolving friend lists when the social graph grows: manual evolution - the user evolves friend lists using no external tools -- and full recommendation -- an existing state of the art tool recommends a whole new set of friend lists. In these comparisons, we used the friend lists of 12 individuals, and simulated the growth of their social graphs and friend lists using our graph-growth model. Intuitively, when the graph evolves by a small (large) amount, the manual (automatic) approach should perform better. Our experiments show that full recommendation performs better than manual when the social graph changes by more than 1%, and yields an almost complete reduction in effort in the best cases.

#! The efficient, distributed factorization of large matrices on clusters of commodity machines is crucial to applying latent factor models in industrial-scale recommender systems. We propose an efficient, data-parallel low-rank matrix factorization with Alternating Least Squares which uses a series of broadcast-joins that can be efficiently executed with MapReduce. We empirically show that the performance of our solution is suitable for real-world use cases. We present experiments on two publicly available datasets and on a synthetic dataset termed Bigflix, generated from the Netflix dataset. Bigflix contains 25 million users and more than 5 billion ratings, mimicking data sizes recently reported as Netflix' production workload. We demonstrate that our approach is able to run an iteration of Alternating Least Squares in six minutes on this dataset. Our implementation has been contributed to the open source machine learning library Apache Mahout.

#! Users often configure complex objects with many possible internal choices. Recommendation engines that automatically configure such objects given user preferences and constraints, may provide much value in such cases. These applications generate appropriate recommendations based on user preferences. It is likely, though, that the user will not be able to fully express her preferences and constraints, requiring a phase of manual tuning of the recommended configuration. We suggest that following this manual revision, additional constraints and preferences can be automatically collected, and the recommended configuration can be automatically improved. Specifically, we suggest a recommender component that takes as input an initial manual configuration of a complex object, deduces certain user preferences and constraints from this configuration, and constructs an alternative configuration. We show an appealing application for our method in complex trip planning, and demonstrate its usability in a user study.

#! Users of scientific papers databases, such as CiteSeer, Google Scholar, and Microsoft Academic, often search for papers using a set of keywords. Unfortunately, many authors avoid listing sufficient keywords for their papers. As such, these applications may need to automatically associate good descriptive keywords with papers. This is a well-studied problem given the complete text of the paper, but in many cases, due to copyright privileges, research papers databases do not have the complete text, only metadata, such as the title and abstract. On the other hand, research papers databases typically maintain the citation network of each paper. In this paper we study the problem of predicting which keywords are appropriate for a scientific paper, using only the citation network. We compare our method with predicting keywords using the title and abstract, concluding that the citation network provides much better predictions.

#! In this research, a food recommendation strategy for patients in a care facility is proposed. Since many of these patients cannot express their personal preferences, a recommender system can assist the caregivers in the selection of the menu items that match the patients' preferences. Recommendations are generated based on three information sources: explicit ratings for menu items, implicit feedback based on the patient's eating behavior and the amount of food that was eaten, and inferred preferences for the ingredients of the menu items. In addition, monitoring the amount of food that was eaten by each patient can provide insights into the optimal amount of each menu item that has to be served to each patient. Furthermore, monitoring food consumption allows to detect irregularities in the eating behavior of the patient, which can be a symptom of illness.

#! Lack of motivation to provide ratings and eligibility to rate generally only after purchase restrain the effectiveness of recommender systems and contribute to the well-known data sparsity and cold start problems. This paper proposes a new information source for recommender systems, called prior ratings. Prior ratings are based on users' experiences of virtual products in a mediated environment, and they can be submitted prior to purchase. A conceptual model of prior ratings is proposed, integrating the environmental factor presence whose effects on product evaluation have not been studied previously. A user study conducted in website and virtual store modalities demonstrates the validity of the conceptual model, in that users are more willing and confident to provide prior ratings in virtual environments.

#! In this paper, we present a method for boosting collaborative filtering by integrating spatial information about geo-referenced items (e.g., photos). In particular, we developed a method to estimate missing ratings by propagating an item's neighbor's ratings based on the similarity of geospatial information. An empirical evaluation shows that geospatial information significantly improves recommendation results, and its contribution grows with the ratings data's level of sparseness. We illustrate the usefulness of the method for a photo recommendation task using data obtained from two popular photo-sharing websites: Flickr and Panoramio. A comparison with state-of-the-art methods indicates the superiority of the proposed method, implying that geospatial information should be considered, when available.

#! User selection data accumulates as time goes by. Although the recent selections are usually assumed to have higher impact on the recommendation accuracy, empirical studies on this problem are limited. For old data, whether they can contribute to the recommendation accuracy is still to be determined. On one hand, changes in short-term user preference over time may limit their effectiveness in prediction, but on the other hand, one cannot rule out their potential in capturing long term user preferences. The result is important for the system owner to determine which data is useful to make the recommendation accurately. While there have been some related studies on the time dependency of data quality using neighbor-based CF methods (e.g., [4]), its effects remain unverified for other CF methods. In this paper, we study the effect of data generated over different time period on recommendation precision using several popular model-based CF algorithms (latent factor models). experiment results show that while more recent data expectedly have larger impacts, the usefulness of older data cannot be ignored as long as there are sufficient old samples. However, the addition of insufficient amount of old data seems to have negative impacts.

#! We study the problem of scoring and selecting content-based features for a collaborative filtering (CF) recommender system. Content-based features play a central role in mitigating the ``cold start'' problem in commercial recommenders. They are also useful in other related tasks, such as recommendation explanation and visualization. However, traditional feature selection methods do not generalize well to recommender systems. As a result, commercial systems typically use manually crafted and selected features. This work presents a framework for automated selection of informative content-based features, that is independent of the type of recommender system or the type of features. We evaluate on recommenders from different domains: books, movies and smart-phone apps, and show effective results on each. In addition, we show how to use the proposed methods to generate meaningful features from text.

With the increasing offer of TV content, there is an emergent need for personalised recommendation solutions, which help users to select programs of interest. In this work, we study the watching patterns of users of an Australian nation-wide catch-up TV service provider and develop a suite of approaches for a catch-up recommendation scenario. We evaluate these approaches using a new large-scale dataset gathered by the Web-based catch-up portal deployed by the provider. The evaluation allows us to compare the performance of several recommenders that address the discovery of both TV programs already watched by users and new programs that users may find relevant.

In order to alleviate cold-start problem, recently systems try to get the users' interests by progressively querying users' preference on predefined items. Constructing the query process via machine learning based techniques becomes an important direction to solve cold-start problem. In this paper, we propose a novel interview process learning algorithm. Different from previous approaches which focus on rate prediction, our model is able to handle wide ranges of loss functions and can be used in collaborative ranking task. Experimental results on three real world recommendation dataset demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several baseline methods.

#! The tremendous popularity of Online Social Networks (OSN) has led to situations, where users have their profiles spread across multiple networks. These partial profiles reflect different user characteristics, depending mainly on the nature of the network, e.g., Facebook's social vs. LinkedIn's professional focus. Combining data gathered by multiple networks may benefit individual users, and the community as a whole, as this could facilitate the provision of more accurate services and recommendations. This paper reports on an exploratory study of the process of making such recommendations using a unique multi-network dataset containing user interests across multiple domains, e.g., music, books, and movies. We represent the data using a graph model and generate recommendations using a set of features extracted from and populated by the model. We assess the contribution of various network- and domain-related features to the accuracy of the recommendations and motivate future work into automated feature selection.

For personalized top-N recommendation task, the combination of relevance and diversity in recommendation results would be desirable. For this purpose, we integrate the concept of diversity into traditional matrix factorization model to construct a set-oriented collaborative filtering model. By optimizing this model with a set-oriented pairwise ranking method, we directly achieve personalized top-N recommendation results which are both relevant and diversified. We also utilize category information explicitly for learning personalized diversity. Experimental results show that our model outperforms traditional models in terms of personalized diversity and maintains good performance on relevance prediction.

#! Most recommenders research aims at personalized systems, which suggest items based on user profiles. However, in reality many systems deal with item-oriented recommendations. In such setups, given a single item of interest, the system needs to provide other related items, following patterns like "people who liked this also liked...". While item-oriented systems are central in their importance, they have been approached so far using very basic tools. We identify several hurdles faced by standard approaches to the item-oriented task. First, the sparseness of observed activities prevents establishing reliable similarity relations for many item pairs. Second, we address a scalability challenge at the retrieval stage present in many real-world systems: Given an item inventory, which may encompass millions of items, it is desired to identify the most related item pairs in a sub-quadratic time. This work addresses these two challenges, thereby improving both accuracy and scalability of item-oriented recommenders. Additionally, we propose an empirical evaluation scheme for comparing the quality of different solutions with encouraging results.

#! Classical matrix factorization approaches to collaborative filtering learn a latent vector for each user and each item, and recommendations are scored via the similarity between two such vectors, which are of the same dimension. In this work, we are motivated by the intuition that a user is a much more complicated entity than any single item, and cannot be well described by the same representation. Hence, the variety of a user's interests could be better captured by a more complex representation. We propose to model the user with a richer set of functions, specifically via a set of latent vectors, where each vector captures one of the user's latent interests or tastes. The overall recommendation model is then nonlinear where the matching score between a user and a given item is the maximum matching score over each of the user's latent interests with respect to the item's latent representation. We describe a simple, general and efficient algorithm for learning such a model, and apply it to large scale, real-world datasets from YouTube and Google Music, where our approach outperforms existing techniques.

#! Making recommendations by learning to rank is becoming an increasingly studied area. Approaches that use stochastic gradient descent scale well to large collaborative filtering datasets, and it has been shown how to approximately optimize the mean rank, or more recently the top of the ranked list. In this work we present a family of loss functions, the k-order statistic loss, that includes these previous approaches as special cases, and also derives new ones that we show to be useful. In particular, we present (i) a new variant that more accurately optimizes precision at k, and (ii) a novel procedure of optimizing the mean maximum rank, which we hypothesize is useful to more accurately cover all of the user's tastes. The general approach works by sampling N positive items, ordering them by the score assigned by the model, and then weighting the example as a function of this ordered set. Our approach is studied in two real-world systems, Google Music and YouTube video recommendations, where we obtain improvements for computable metrics, and in the YouTube case, increased user click through and watch duration when deployed live on www.youtube.com.

AR adds virtual objects into a user's real-world environment enabling live interaction in three dimensions. Limited by the small display of AR devices, content selection is one of the key issues to improve user experience. In this paper, we present an aggregated random walk algorithm incorporating personal preferences, location information, and temporal information in a layered graph. By adaptively changing the graph edge weight and computing the rank score, the proposed AR recommender system predicts users' preferences and provides the most relevant recommendations with aggregated information.

Meanwhile, an iterative random walk with restarts learning method is proposed on the Bi-Relational graph to recommend a researcher rating for each article by making use of the known information. The proposed method has ability to perform both old and new article recommendation. A series of experiments on CiteULike dataset have shown that our method is more effective than other testing methods in the paper.

#! We describe a hybrid recommendation system at LinkedIn that seeks to optimally extract relevant information pertaining to items to be recommended. By extending the notion of an item profile, we propose the concept of a "virtual profile" that augments the content of the item with rich set of features inherited from members who have already shown explicit interest in it. Unlike item-based collaborative filtering, we focus on discovering the characteristic descriptors that underlie the item-user association. Such information is used as supplemental features in a content-based filtering system. The main objective of virtual profiles is to provide a means to tap into rich-content information from one type of entity and propagate features extracted from which to other affiliated entities that may suffer from relative data scarcity. We empirically evaluate the proposed method on a real-world community recommendation problem at LinkedIn. The result shows that the virtual profiles outperform a collaborative filtering based approach (user who likes this also likes that). In particular, the improvement is more significant for new users with only limited connections, demonstrating the capability of the method to address the cold-start problem in pure collaborative filtering systems.

#! Users of online social networks such as dating websites often need help to find successful matches. People-to-people recommender systems can be used in social networks to help users find better matches, which requires solving the problem of reciprocal recommendation. However, most existing reciprocal recommenders use either profile similarity or interaction similarity to recommend new matches, without considering temporal features. In this paper we introduce a method for temporal reciprocal recommender systems using Hidden Markov Models to generate recommendations. Instead of summarising the whole historical data in one past state, we propose a model that formalises historical data on interactions as a series of successive states changing over time and then tries to find the recommended next state. We have implemented this new approach and the results of testing on industrial-scale data from a real dating website show a noticeable improvement over the previous best-performing recommenders.

#! In this paper, we propose Personalized Markov Embedding (PME), a next-song recommendation strategy for online karaoke users. By modeling the sequential singing behavior, we first embed songs and users into a Euclidean space in which distances between songs and users reflect the strength of their relationships. Then, given each user's last song, we can generate personalized recommendations by ranking the candidate songs according to the embedding. Moreover, PME can be trained without any requirement of content information. Finally, we perform an experimental evaluation on a real world data set provided by ihou.com which is an online karaoke website launched by iFLYTEK, and the results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of PME.

#! Query revisions in a conversational system can be efficiently computed by assuming that the profiles of the potential users are in a predefined, a priori known and finite set. However, without any additional knowledge of the actual profiles distribution, the system may miss the true profiles of the users, hence deteriorating the system performance. We propose a method for identifying a tailored set of profiles that is acquired by analysing the implicitly shown preferences of the users that interacted with the system. We show that with the proposed method the system can efficiently identify good query revisions.

#! Context-Aware Recommender Systems locally adapt to a specific contextual situation the rating prediction computed by a traditional context-free recommender. In this paper we present a novel semantic pre-filtering approach that can be tuned to the optimal level of contextualization by aggregating contextual situations that are similar to the target one. The similarities of contextual situations are derived from the available contextually tagged users' ratings according to how similarly the contextual conditions influence the user's rating behavior. We present an extensive evaluation of the performance of our pre-filtering approach on several data sets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art context-aware Matrix Factorization approaches.

#! Existing studies indicate that there exists strong correlation between personality and personal preference, thus personality could potentially be used to build more personalized recommender system. Personality traits are mainly measured by psychological questionnaires, and it is hard to obtain personality traits of large amount of users in real-world scenes.In this paper, we propose a new approach to automatically identify personality traits with Social Media contents in Chinese language environments. Social Media content features were extracted from 1766 Sina micro blog users, and the predicting model is trained with machine learning algorithms.The experimental results demonstrate that users' personality traits could be predicted from Social Media contents with acceptable Pearson Correlation, which makes it possible to develop user profiles for recommender system. In future, user profiles with predicted personality traits would be used to enhance the performance of existing personalized recommendation systems.

#! Power users, in a Collaborative Filtering (CF) Recommender System (RS) context, are those who can exert considerable influence over the recommendation outcomes presented to other users. RS operators encourage the existence of power user communities and leverage them to help fellow users make informed purchase decisions. Thus, RS research in this area has focused on power user identification and utilization to address challenges such as rating sparsity for new items or users. But, as ever, there remains the potential for corruption of power. Alongside accuracy and efficiency measures, RS robustness to manipulation or 'attack' has been studied using injection of false user profiles. Our research is investigating the impact on RS predictions and top-N recommendation lists when simulated power users provide biased ratings for new items. In this study, we introduce the notion of a 'Power User Attack' for RS robustness analysis, as well as a novel use of social networking degree centrality concepts for identifying RS power users. Initial results show that power users identified using in-degree centrality, compared to other techniques, can be more influential as reflected by accuracy and robustness impacts before and after power user attacks.

#! One of the most challenging recommendation tasks is recommending to a new, previously unseen user. This is known as the user cold start problem. Assuming certain features or attributes of users are known, one approach for handling new users is to initially model them based on their features. Motivated by an ad targeting application, this paper describes an extreme online recommendation setting where the cold start problem is perpetual. Every user is encountered by the system just once, receives a recommendation, and either consumes or ignores it, registering a binary reward. We introduce One-pass Factorization of Feature Sets, 'OFF-Set', a novel recommendation algorithm based on Latent Factor analysis, which models users by mapping their features to a latent space. OFF-Set is able to model non-linear interactions between pairs of features, and updates its model per each recommendation-reward observation in a pure online fashion. We evaluate OFF-Set against several state of the art baselines, and demonstrate its superiority on real ad-targeting data.

#! Since the rise of collaborative tagging systems on the web, the tag recommendation task -- suggesting suitable tags to users of such systems while they add resources to their collection -- has been tackled. However, the (offline) evaluation of tag recommendation algorithms usually suffers from difficulties like the sparseness of the data or the cold start problem for new resources or users. Previous studies therefore often used so-called post-cores (specific subsets of the original datasets) for their experiments. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale experiment in which we analyze different tag recommendation algorithms on different cores of three real-world datasets. We show, that a recommender's performance depends on the particular core and explore correlations between performances on different cores.

#! In order to predict user behaviour recommender systems generate views of the world according to expressed and known user preferences resulting in 'filter bubbles'. This kind of bubbles generally help users to easily identify objects they like. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult for users to escape their personalized world and change their perspectives especially in domains such as music. In this work we present a methodology and related system that allows users to initiate explorations of music genres by taking a gradual path towards the desired genre while viewing the preferences of other users. The proposed methodology is based on identifying 'latent genres' and using user preference graphs for detecting optimal paths towards a selected target latent genre. In this process we generate suggestions of artists a user should listen to, aiming towards serendipitous and novel encounters. We have implemented our approach in a music recommendation system and evaluated it with encouraging results.

#! Bayesian Inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) has been shown to provide high prediction quality in recommender systems. The advantage over learning methods such as coordinate descent/alternating least-squares (ALS) or (stochastic) gradient descent (SGD) is that MCMC takes uncertainty into account and moreover MCMC can easily integrate priors to learn regularization values. For factorization models, MCMC inference can be done with efficient Gibbs samplers. However, MCMC algorithms are not point estimators, but they generate a chain of models. The whole chain of models is used to calculate predictions. For large scale models like factorization methods with millions or billions of model parameters, saving the whole chain of models is very storage intensive and can even get infeasible in practice. In this paper, we address this problem and show how a small subset from the chain of models can approximate the predictive distribution well. We use the fact that models from the chain are correlated and propose online selection techniques to store only a small subset of the models. We perform an empirical analysis on the large scale Netflix dataset with several Bayesian factorization models, including matrix factorization and SVD++. We show that the proposed selection techniques approximate the predictions well with only a small subset of model samples.

#! In a number of domains of interest for recommender systems, items are characterized by constrained and variable "capacity": the same product or service can be consumed by a limited number of users and the possibility of item consumption depends on contextual circumstances (e.g., time). Our work explores recommenders in the context of these "bounded" domains. We consider online hotel booking as a case study, and investigates if and how "missing" items (hotels that eventually becomes unavailable for users' consumption) affect the quality of recommendations. The paper proposes a technique for defining "missing" items as "best items", and presents an articulated empirical research in which recommendations for hotel online booking are evaluated in different experimental conditions with a user centric approach involving 142 participants.

#! In this paper we discuss a method to incorporate diversity into a personalised ranking objective, in the context of ranking-based recommendation using implicit feedback. The goal is to provide a ranking of items that respects user preferences while also tending to rank diverse items closely together. A prediction formula is learned as the product of user and item feature vectors, in order to minimise the mean squared error objective used previously in the RankALS and RankSGD methods, but modified to weight the difference in ratings between two items by the dissimilarity of those items. We report on preliminary experiments with this modified objective, in which the minimisation is carried out using stochastic gradient descent. We show that rankings based on the output of the minimisation succeed in producing recommendation lists with greater diversity, with just a small loss in relevance of the recommendation, as measured by the error rate.

#! Extended Collaborative Less-is-More Filtering xCLiMF is a learning to rank model for collaborative filtering that is specifically designed for use with data where information on the level of relevance of the recommendations exists, e.g. through ratings. xCLiMF can be seen as a generalization of the Collaborative Less-is-More Filtering (CLiMF) method that was proposed for top-N recommendations using binary relevance (implicit feedback) data. The key contribution of the xCLiMF algorithm is that it builds a recommendation model by optimizing Expected Reciprocal Rank, an evaluation metric that generalizes reciprocal rank in order to incorporate user feedback with multiple levels of relevance. Experimental results on real-world datasets show the effectiveness of xCLiMF, and also demonstrate its advantage over CLiMF when more than two levels of relevance exist in the data.

#! Daily deals sites (DDSs), such as Groupon and LivingSocial, attract millions of customers in the hunt for products and services at significantly reduced prices. A typical approach to increase revenue is to send email messages featuring the deals of the day. Such daily messages, however, are usually not centered on the customers, instead, all registered users typically receive similar messages with almost the same deals. Traditional recommendation algorithms are innocuous in DDSs because: (i) most of the users are sporadic bargain hunters, and thus past preference data is extremely sparse, (ii) deals have a short living period, and thus data is extremely volatile, and (iii) user taste and interest may undergo temporal drifts. In order to address such particularly challenging scenario, we propose new algorithms for daily deals recommendation based on the explore-then-exploit strategy.Users are split into exploration and exploitation sets -- in the exploration set the users receive non-personalized messages and a co-purchase network is updated with user feedback for purchases of the day, while in the exploitation set the updated network is used for recommending personalized messages for the remaining users.A thorough evaluation of our algorithms using real data obtained from a large daily deals website in Brazil in contrast to state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms show gains in precision ranging from 18% to 34%.

This paper proposes a novel method for estimating unknown ratings and recommendation opportunities and illustrates the practical implementation of the proposed approach by presenting a certain variation of the classical k-NN method in neighborhood-based collaborative filtering systems using weighted percentiles. We conduct an empirical study showing that the proposed method outperforms the standard user-based collaborative filtering approach by a wide margin in terms of item prediction accuracy and utility-based ranking metrics across various experimental settings. We also demonstrate that this performance improvement is not achieved at the expense of other popular performance measures, such as catalog coverage and aggregate diversity. The proposed approach can also be applied to other popular methods for rating estimation.

#! Recent studies suggest that by using additional user or item relationship information when building hybrid recommender systems, the recommendation quality can be largely improved. However, most such studies only consider a single type of relationship, e.g., social network. Notice that in many applications, the recommendation problem exists in an attribute-rich heterogeneous information network environment. In this paper, we study the entity recommendation problem in heterogeneous information networks. We propose to combine various relationship information from the network with user feedback to provide high quality recommendation results. The major challenge of building recommender systems in heterogeneous information networks is to systematically define features to represent the different types of relationships between entities, and learn the importance of each relationship type. In the proposed framework, we first use meta-path-based latent features to represent the connectivity between users and items along different paths in the related information network. We then define a recommendation model with such latent features and use Bayesian ranking optimization techniques to estimate the model. Empirical studies show that our approach outperforms several widely employed implicit feedback entity recommendation techniques.

#! Factorized collaborative models show a promising accuracy and scalability in recommendation systems. They employ the latent collaborative information of users and items to achieve higher accuracy of recommendation. In this paper, we propose a new approach to improve the accuracy of two well-known, highly scalable factorized models: SVD++ and Asymmetric-SVD++. These are cutting-edge factorized models that have played a key role in the Netflix prize winner's solution. We first employ collaborative information to categorize the users and items. We then discover the shared interests between these categories. Including this new information, we extend these cutting-edge models regarding two main goals: 1) to improve their recommendation accuracies; 2) to keep the extended models still scalable. Finally, we evaluate our proposed models on two recommendation datasets: MovieLens100k, and Netflix. Our experiment shows that adding the shared interests among categories into these models improves their accuracy while maintaining scalability.

When an experiment is repeated by a different researcher and exactly the same result is obtained, we can say the experiment has been replicated. When the results are not exactly the same but the conclusions are compatible with the prior ones, we have a reproduction of the experiment.

#! While Recommender Systems are powerful drivers of engagement and transactional utility in social networks, People recommenders are a fairly involved and diverse subdomain. Consider that movies are recommended to be watched, news is recommended to be read, people however, are recommended for a plethora of reasons -- such as recommendation of people to befriend, follow, partner, targets for an advertisement or service, recruiting, partnering romantically and to join thematic interest groups. This tutorial aims to first describe the problem domain, touch upon classical approaches like link analysis and collaborative filtering and then take a rapid deep dive into the unique aspects of this problem space like reciprocity, intent understanding of recommender and the recomendee, contextual people recommendations in communication flows and social referrals -- a paradigm for delivery of recommendations using the social graph. These aspects will be discussed in the context of published original work developed by the authors and their collaborators and in many cases deployed in massive-scale real world applications on professional networks such as LinkedIn.

#! The problem of information overload has been a relevant and active research topic for the past twenty years. Since then, numerous algorithms and recommendation approaches have been proposed, which gives rise to a new type of problem: recommendation algorithm overload. Although hybrid recommendation techniques, which combine the strengths of individual recommenders, have become well-accepted, the procedure of building and tuning a hybrid recommender is still a tedious and time-consuming process. In our work, we focus on dynamically building personalized hybrid recommender systems on an individual user basis. By means of a dynamic online learning strategy we combine the most appropriate recommendation algorithms for a user based on realtime relevance feedback. Learning effectiveness of genetic algorithms, machine learning techniques and other optimization approaches will be studied in both an offline and online setting.

#! Power users, in a Collaborative Filtering (CF) Recommender System (RS) context, are those who can exert considerable influence over the recommendation outcomes presented to other users. RS operators encourage the existence of power user communities and leverage them to help fellow users make informed purchase decisions. Thus, RS research in this area has focused on power user selection and utilization to address challenges such as rating sparsity for new items or users. But, as ever, there remains the potential for corruption by power users who provide biased ratings. And because of the influence that power users wield, biased ratings they provide can have significant impacts on RS accuracy and robustness. In order to better understand this problem and develop solution strategies, our research is investigating the impact on RS predictions and top-N recommendation lists when power users provide biased ratings. The open areas of research we have explored are analyzing and evaluating power user selection techniques, statistically characterizing power users in order to create attack profiles, mounting power user attacks on new items, and using accuracy and robustness metrics to evaluate power user attacks. In the future, we plan to extend our initial research in power user selection, characterization, and evaluation, as well as generate attack profiles based on power user characteristics, mount power user attacks on user-based, item-based, and SVD-based CF systems, evaluate power user attacks, and generalize our work across different domains.

#! Our research aims to tackle the problems of data sparsity and cold start of traditional recommender systems. Insufficient ratings often result in poor quality of recommendations in terms of accuracy and coverage. To address these issues, we propose three different approaches from the perspective of preference modelling. Firstly, we propose to merge the ratings of trusted neighbors and thus form a new rating profile for the active users, based on which better recommendations can be generated. Secondly, we aim to make better use of user ratings and introduce a novel Bayesian similarity measure by taking into account both the direction and length of rating vectors. Thirdly, we propose a new information source called prior ratings based on virtual product experience in virtual reality environments, in order to inherently resolve the concerned problems.

#! The fast development of computing and communication has reformed the financial markets' dynamics. Nowadays many people are investing and trading stocks through online channels and having access to real-time market information efficiently. There are more opportunities to lose or make money with all the stocks information available throughout the World; however, one should spend a lot of effort and time to follow those stocks and the available instant information. This paper presents a preliminary regarding a multi-agent recommender system for computational investing. This system utilizes a hybrid filtering technique to adaptively recommend the most profitable stocks at the right time according to investor's personal favour. The hybrid technique includes collaborative and content-based filtering. The content-based model uses investor preferences, influencing macro-economic factors, stocks profiles and the predicted trend to tailor to its advices. The collaborative filter assesses the investor pairs' investing behaviours and actions that are proficient in economic market to recommend the similar ones to the target investor.

#! This paper proposes a number of studies in order to move recommender systems beyond the traditional paradigm and the classical perspective of rating prediction accuracy. We contribute to existing helpful but less explored paradigms and also propose new approaches aiming at more useful recommendations for both users and businesses. Working toward this direction, we discuss the studies we have conducted so far and present our future research plans. In particular, we move our focus from even more accurate rating predictions and aim at offering a holistic experience to the users by avoiding the over-specialization of generated recommendations and providing the users with sets of non-obvious but high quality recommendations that fairly match their interests and they will remarkably like.

#! Many small and mid-sized e-businesses use the services of recommender system (RS) provider companies to outsource the construction and maintenance of their RS. The fees that RS providers charge their clients must cover the computation costs for constructing and updating the recommendation model. By using anytime algorithms, a RS provider can control the computation costs and still offer a system capable of delivering reasonable recommendations. Thus, a RS provider should be able to stop the construction of a recommendation model once the cost for compu-ting it reaches the amount the customer has agreed to pay. In this research we suggest anytime algorithms as a possible solu-tion to a problem that RS providers face. We demonstrate how certain existing recommendation algorithms can be adjusted to the anytime framework. We focus on the case of item-item algorithms, showing how the anytime behavior can be improved using different ordering methods of computations. We conduct a comparative study demonstrating the benefits of the proposed methods for top-N item-item recommenders.

#! GAIN (inbeat.eu) is a web application and service for capturing and preprocessing user interactions with semantically described content. GAIN outputs a set of instances in tabular form suitable for further processing with generic machine-learning algorithms. GAIN is demoed as a component of a "SMART-TV" recommender system. Content is automatically described with DBpedia types using a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system. Interest is determined based on explicit user actions and user's attention computed by 3D head pose estimation. Preference rules are learnt with an association rule mining algorithm. These can be e.g. deployed to a business rules system, acting as a recommender.

#! Heterogeneous graph-based recommendation frameworks have flexibility in that they can incorporate various recommendation algorithms and various kinds of information to produce better results. In this demonstration, we present a heterogeneous graph-based recommendation simulator which enables participants to experience the flexibility of a heterogeneous graph-based recommendation method. With our system, participants can simulate various recommendation semantics by expressing the semantics via meaningful paths like User → Movie → User → Movie. The simulator then returns the recommendation results on the fly based on the user-customized semantics using a fast Monte Carlo algorithm.

However, it can be difficult to maintain the responsiveness with this approach when there are large numbers of concurrent users. In this demonstration we present an alternative approach where major parts of the recommender system are implemented in scripts run by the user's client system.
