The aim of DTV's Article Database Service (DADS) is to offer our end users a whole new generation of library services with integrated search and browse facilities, a common user interface and direct electronic document delivery - all accessible from their own desks. The system should handle bibliographic data, including abstracts as well as articles in full text and table-of-contents data. Using an electronic article database service users can access a particular article or journal within seconds rather than hours or days typical for paper based collections. Large collections of material can be searched simultaneously and retrieved instantly. There is also the possibility for active dissemination of information based on "interest profiles" of users, ie current awareness services.

#! Video is a major media in the society of information under way. Unfortunately, the full use of this media is limited by the opaque character of the video which prevents content-based access. In this paper we improve our previous spatial temporal clues-based semantic video segmentation technique, and propose the use of the rhythm within a video to more precisely capture temporal relations within a scene and between scenes in a video. Preliminary evidence based on a 7 minutes video shows that our spatial temporal clues-based segmentation technique coupled with the rhythm consideration fully detect the narrative structure of a video.

#! In this paper, we present the design and implementation of NetBazaar, which is a distributed, federated electronic trading system (Marketplace) for buying and selling network resources and services and information products and services distributed across the Internet. The trading system provides mechanisms for suppliers to advertise information about their services and attribute-value pairs, and for consumers to query for information about service offerings by the suppliers. In addition, the trading system offers services to perform the trades on behalf of the consumers or it offers the consumers with a list of suppliers to contact. In order to recover costs and profit, the trading system charges a small fee to the suppliers and consumers for every trade that occurs. The charges could vary depending on the complexity of the trade, such as the overheads of payment, transaction and contract enforcement. NetBazaar has been designed to support a variety of business models, pricing and market mechanisms, searching and matching algorithms, fast negotiation mechanisms for a high volume of trades, and distributed access for consumers and suppliers to the trading system. An initial version of NetBazaar has been implemented using CORBA and Java components.

#! The recent explosion of the internet has made digital libraries popular. The user-friendly interface of Web browsers allows a user much easier access to the digital library. However, to retrieve relevant documents from the digital library, the user is provided with a search interface consisting of one input field and one push button. Most users type in a single keyword, click the button, and hope for the best. The result of a query using this kind of search interface can consist of a large unordered set of documents, or a ranked list of documents based on the frequency of the keywords. Both lists can contain articles unrelated to user's inquiry unless a sophisticated search was performed and the user knows exactly what to look for. More sophisticated algorithms for ranking the relevance of search results may help, but what is desperately needed are software tools that can analyze the search result and manipulate large hierarchies of data graphically. In this paper, we present a language-independent document classification system for the Florida Center for Library Automation to help users analyze the search query results. Easy access through the Web is provided, as well as a graphical user interface to display the classification results.

#! In this paper we describe the results of experiments contrasting syntactic phrase indexing with statistical phrase indexing for Dutch texts. Our results showed that we at least need a compound splitting algorithm for good quality retrieval for Dutch texts. If we then add either syntactic or statistical phrases, performance generally improves, but this effect is never statistically significant. If we compare syntactic vs. statistical phrase indexing, syntactic phrases are slightly superior to statistical phrases, particularly at high precision. At higher recall levels syntactic and statistical phrases are equally effective. However, since a compound splitting algorithm requires a dictionary and knowledge about constraints on compound formation, a purely non-linguistic indexing strategy, with or without phrases, does not seem to be very effective for Dutch.

#! The World Wide Web (WWW) covers the globe. However, the browsing functions for documents in multiple languages are not easily accessed by occasional users. Functions to display and input multilingual texts in digital libraries are clearly crucial. Multilingual HTML (MHTML)is a document browser technology for multilingual documents on the WWW. The authors developed a display function for multilingual documents based on MHTML technology and extended it to text inputs in multiple languages for off-the-shelf browsers and sample applications. This extension creates an environment for digital library end-users, wherein they can view and search multilingual documents using any off-the-shelf browser. This paper also discusses the lessons learned from the MHTML project.

This architecture is being implemented in the context of a broader research project to develop next-generation service modules for a layered digital library architecture.

#! The Planetary Data System (PDS) is an active science data archive managed by scientists for NASA's planetary science community. With the advent of the World Wide Web, the majority of the archive has been placed on-line as a science digital library for access by scientists, the educational community, and the general public. The meta-data in this archive, primarily collected to ensure that future scientists would be able to understand the context within which the science data was collected and archived, has enabled the development of sophisticated on-line interfaces. The success of this effort is primarily due to the development of a standards architecture based on a formal model of the planetary science domain. A peer review process for validating the meta-data and the science data has been critical in maintaining a consistent archive. In support of new digital library research initiatives, the PDS functions as a case study in the development and management of meta-data for science digital libraries.

#* Reduction of Expanded Search Terms for Fuzzy English-Text Retrieval

#! Optical character reader (OCR) misrecognition is a serious problem when OCR-recognized text is used for retrieval purposes in digital libraries. We have proposed fuzzy retrieval methods that, instead of correcting the errors manually, assume that errors remain in the recognized text. Costs are thereby reduced. The proposed methods generate multiple search terms for each input query term by referring to the confusion matrices, which store all characters likely to be misrecognized and the respective probability of each misrecognition. The proposed methods can improve recall rates without decreasing precision rates. However, in English fuzzy retrieval, occasionally a few million search terms are generated, which has an intolerable effect on retrieval speed. Therefore, this paper presents two heuristics to reduce the number of generated search terms by restricting the number of errors included in each expanded search term while maintaining retrieval effectiveness.

#! A multilingual information retrieval method is presented where the user formulates the query in his/her preferred language to retrieve relevant information from a multilingual document collection. This multilingual retrieval method involves mono- and cross-language searches as well as merging their results. We adopt a corpus based approach where documents of different languages are associated if they cover a similar story. The resulting comparable corpus enables two novel techniques we have developed. First, it enables Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) which does not lack vocabulary coverage as we observed in the case of approaches that are based on automatic Machine Translation (MT). Second, aligned documents of this corpus facilitate to merge the results of mono- and cross-language searches. Using the TREC CLIR data, excellent results are obtained. In addition, our evaluation of the document alignments gives us new insights about the usefulness of comparable corpora.

#! In this paper, we describe the architecture and initial implementation of a content-based retrieval mechanism from heterogeneous image archives. In particular, we propose an architecture to produce local representation of the images stored in heterogeneous archives and a progressive framework that reorganizes the images into a hierarchical representation based on a multiresolution decomposition and an abstraction pyramid. Search operations can rely on this representation and be performed in a hierarchical fashion, thus significantly reducing the total amount of data that need to be processed. Dramatic speedup has been achieved for many search operations, such as template matching, texture feature extraction, and histogram extraction.

#! We present an overview of a large combined querying and retrieval system that performs content-based on-line searches in a large database of multimedia documents (currently text, tables and colour images). Queries are submitted as sentences in natural language and are transformed into the language of the target database. The documents are analyzed semantically for their information content; in a data fusion step the individual pieces of information extracted from these documents are aggregated into cognitively adequate result documents. There is no pre-indexing necessary when new documents are stored into the system. This retains a high degree of flexibility with respect to the questions that may be asked. It implies, however, that both huge amounts of data must be evaluated rapidly and that intelligent caching strategies must be employed. It is therefore mandatory that the system be equipped with dedicated high-speed hardware processors. The complete system is currently available as a prototype; the paper outlines its architecture and gives examples of some real sample queries in the knowledge domain of weather data documents.

#! Researchers in multilingual information retrieval and natural language processing are making progress on algorithms for guessing what a text is about and for translating queries between languages; some day we may have reliable programs for recognizing musical melodies or the content of images. In contrast, researchers in metadata focus more on seeking consensus on the meanings of categories for describing resources; on finding ways to allow simple schemas to interoperate with complex ones; and on designing frameworks for managing the messy equivalencies between metadata models in different fields and languages. Do the two perspectives form a continuum? What problems do they solve best? For resource discovery, what is the best balance between human and machine?.

#! Digital libraries offer much promise for patrons and many challenges for system designers and implementers. One important issue that faces digital library system designers is the type of support provided to patrons for intellectual work. Although many researchers have noted the desirability of robust hypermedia structuring facilities in digital library systems, this research has tended to focus on navigational hypermedia (primarily used for associative storage and retrieval) only. Many other types of hypermedia, such as spatial, issue-based, and taxonomic, have been ignored. We briefly review some of our experiences with building digital library systems and discuss some of the lessons we learned from our initial prototypes. We then present a scenario of digital library work that illustrates many of the kinds of tasks we have observed users of our systems perform. We use this scenario to suggest a potential area of improvement for current hypermedia support in digital library systems and discuss some of our initial work in this area. Finally, we present some directions of future work and some concluding remarks.

#! Current electronic product catalogs support only Hard Navigation in the product list. Products or product categories are displayed only if they match a criterion that a user has specified explicitly as a constraint or implicitly by following a navigation link. Hard navigation is problematic if users want to express soft preferences instead of hard constraints. Users will make sub-optimal buying decisions if they mistake soft preferences for hard requirements and focus only on products that match all their preferences. Soft Navigation is an alternative means to navigate product catalogs. Users express preferences which are used to evaluate products and display them in such a way that higher-scoring products are more visible than lower-scoring products. This paper presents a product scoring catalog (PSC) that supports soft navigation and allows users to express preferences and rate their importance by following a set of rules. The paper closes by outlining possible extensions to PSC and indicating research issues related to soft navigation product catalogs.

#! In this paper we discuss the construction of an automated information system for a collection of visual reproductions of art objects. Special attention is payed to the economical aspects of such a system, which appears to be mainly a problem of data entry. An approach is discussed to make this feasible, which also strongly provokes consistency between descriptions. Another main target of such a system is the capability for effective disclosure. This requires a disclosure mechanism on descriptions which is easy to handle by non technical users. We show the usefulness of query by navigation for this purpose. It allows the searcher to stepwise build a query in terms of (semi-)natural language. At each step, the searcher is presented with context sensitive information. The resulting system is described and we discuss an experiment of its use.

#! Current publications are more and more available in electronic form. Nevertheless there is still a clear predominance of printed material within library holdings. In order to facilitate online access to these information the Center for Digitization at Göttingen University Library was initiated as innovative service center for digitization work and techniques, financially supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the Ministry of Culture of the Federal State of Lower Saxony. Setting up a Document-Management-System (DMS) as key component for the digital library architecture is one of the overall goals for the Center. Starting with Saros Mezzanine, a traditional EDMS for companies from FileNet, we present now, as result of a collaboration with the Satz-Rechen-Zentrum (SRZ) company in Berlin, a comfortable system named AGORA. The article gives a brief overview over development and functionality of the new DMS for digital libraries, AGORA.

#! Technical terms (henceforth called simply terms), are important elements for digital libraries. In this paper we present a domain-independent method for the automatic extraction of multi-word terms, from machine-readable special language corpora. The method, (C-value/NC-value), combines linguistic and statistical information. The first part, C-value enhances the common statistical measure of frequency of occurrence for term extraction, making it sensitive to a particular type of multi-word terms, the nested terms. The second part, NC-value, gives: 1) a method for the extraction of term context words (words that tend to appear with terms), 2) the incorporation of information from term context words to the extraction of terms.

#! The World Wide Web (WWW) is an hypermedia of heterogeneous and dynamic documents, frequently referred to be the world wide digital library. This virtual space is growing more and more every day, offering to the user a huge amount of data. Two kinds of tasks can be handled to locate a relevant document through this space: querying and browsing. Querying is appropriate when the user has a clear goal which should usually be expressed through a list of keywords. Different servers on the WWW (such as Yahoo, Lycos, Altavista) can be then used to retrieve matching documents based on their indexing capability. Browsing is well suited when the user cannot express his goal explicitly or when query formulation by keywords is not adequate. Then, the user must navigate through this space, moving from one node to another, looking for a relevant document. These two tasks can be mixed so that querying gives a list of reasonable starting points for browsing.

#! IDL (Intelligent Digital Library) is a prototypical intelligent digital library service that is currently being developed at the University of Bari. Among the characterizing features of IDL there are a retrieval engine and several facilities available for the library users. In this paper, we present the web-based visual environment we have developed with the aim of improving the user-library interaction. The IDL environment is equipped with some novel visual tools, that are primarily intended for inexperienced users, who represent most of the users that usually access digital libraries. Machine Learning techniques have been exploited in IDL for document analysis, classification, and understanding, as well as for building a user modeling module, that is the basic component for providing IDL with user interface adaptivity. This feature is also discussed in the paper.

#! The availability of central reference information as thesauri is critical for correct intellectual access to distributed databases, in particular to digital collections in international networks. There is a continuous raise in interest in thesauri, and several thesaurus management systems have appeared on the market. The issue, how to integrate effectively such central resources into a multitude of client systems and to maintain the consistency of reference in an information network has not yet been satisfactorily solved. We present here a method and an actual thesaurus management system, which is specifically designed for this use, and implements the necessary data structures and management functions. The system handles multiple multilingual thesauri and can be adapted to all semantic thesaurus structures currently in use. Consistency-critical information is kept as history of changes in the form of backward differences. The system has been installed at several sites in Europe.

#! In this paper we propose a methodology for organising the users of an information providing system into groups with common interests (communities). The communities are built using unsupervised learning techniques on data collected from the users (user models). We examine a system that filters news on the Internet, according to the interests of the registered users. Each user model contains the user's interests on the news categories covered by the information providing system. Two learning algorithms are evaluated: COBWEB and ITERATE. Our main concern is whether meaningful communities can be constructed. We specify a metric to decide which news categories are representative for each community. The construction of meaningful communities can be used for improving the structure of the information providing system as well as for suggesting extensions to individual user models. Encouraging results on a large data-set lead us to consider this work as a first step towards a method that can easily be integrated in a variety of information systems.

#! Cornell University Department of Preservation and Conservation and Picture Elements, Incorporated have undertaken a joint study for the Library of Congress to determine the best means for digitizing the vast array of illustrations used in 19th and early 20th century publications. This work builds on two previous studies. A Cornell study [1] characterized a given illustration type based upon its essence, detail, and structure. A Picture Elements study [2] created guidelines for deciding how a given physical content region type should be captured as an electronic content type. Using those procedures, appropriate mappings of different physical content regions (representing instances of different illustration processes) to electronic content types are being created. These mappings differ based on the illustration type and on the need to preserve information at the essence, detail, or structure level. Example pages that are typical of early commercial illustrations have been identified, characterized in terms of the processes used to create them (e.g., engraving, lithograph, halftone) and then scanned at high resolutions in 8-bit grayscale. Digital versions that retain evidence of information at the structure level have been derived from those scans and their fidelity studied alongside the paper originals. Project staff have investigated the available means for automatic detection of illustration content regions and methods for automatically discriminating different illustration process types and for encoding and processing them. A public domain example utility is being created which automatically detects the presence and location of a halftone region in a scan of an illustrated book page and applies special processing to it.

First, attempting to find the best use of speech recogniser output to produce the highest retrieval effectiveness. Second, investigating the potential problems of retrieving from a so-called "mixed collection", i.e. one that contains documents from both a speech recognition system (producing many errors) and from hand transcription (producing presumably near perfect documents). The result of the first part of the work found that merging the transcripts of multiple recognisers showed most promise. The investigation in the second part showed how the term weighting scheme used in a retrieval system was important in determining whether the system was affected detrimentally when retrieving from a mixed collection.

Container technology enables the encapsulation of information content together with rules and controls specifying the types of content usage permitted and the consequences of usage, such as triggering of report generation and payment. Containers have been proposed as a mechanism for securing intellectual property rights. This paper outlines other possible applications of container technology, including support for compound documents that incorporate active content, and automation of processes involving multi-party peer-to-peer interactions for the purposes of collaboration and commerce. Such value-added services are of particular interest in the context of digital libraries aiming to provide functionality extending beyond that of a simple repository of electronic documents. This paper presents the design of a container framework in the context of an architecture for network-centric applications.

#! In this paper we investigate a general purpose interactive information organization system. The system organizes documents by placing them into 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional space based on their similarity and a spring-embedding algorithm. We begin by designing a method for estimating the quality of the organization when it is applied to a set of documents returned in response to a query. We show how the relevant documents tend to clump with each other in space. We proceed by presenting a method for measuring the amount of structure in the organization and we explain how this knowledge can be used to refine the system. We also show that increasing the dimensionality of the organization generally improves its quality. We introduce two methods for modifying the organization based on the information obtained from the user and show how such feedback improves the organization. All the analysis is done off-line without direct user intervention.

#! Digital libraries offer a vast source of very different information. To enable users to fruitfully browse through a collection of documents without necessarily having to state a complex query, advanced retrieval techniques have to be developed. Those methods have to be able to structure information in a semantic manner. This work presents some first steps in semantically organizing thematically pre-selected documents of a digital library. The semantic structure of the document collection will be expressively visualized by the proposed system. We illustrate our ideas using a database of medical abstracts from the field of oncology as a walking example.

The Performing Arts Data Service (PADS) aims to support research and teaching in UK Higher Education by collecting and promoting the use of digital data relating to the performing arts: music, film, broadcast arts, theatre, dance. The PADS is one of 5 service providers of the Arts and Humanities Data Service (AHDS) which will provide a single gateway for arts and humanities scholars wishing to search for datasets across various discipline areas. Data is indexed with Dublin Core metadata, will interoperate with other databases within the AHDS and beyond using Z39.50, and will be available via the Web. The diversity of data with which the PADS must deal is a major issue, and any information system for such a service must support text based, visual/image, time-based and complex data, and offer appropriate access over wide area networks. This paper focuses on the system requirements of such a system and briefly describes one implementation of those requirements.

As experimental digital library testbeds gain wider acceptance and develop significant user bases, it becomes important to investigate the ways in which users interact with the systems in practice. Transaction logs are one source of usage information, and the information on user behaviour can be culled from them both automatically (through calculation of summary statistics) and manually (by examining query strings for semantic clues on search motivations and searching strategy). We conduct a transaction log analysis on user activity in the Computer Science Technical Reports Collection of the New Zealand Digital Library, and report insights gained and identify resulting search interface design issues.

#! Electronic journals are becoming a major source of scientific information. Researchers interested only in certain topics do not have time to scan all possibly relevant journals on a regular basis. A digital library can assist them by providing a uniform, search-able interface for electronic journals. To this purpose, a catalogue of metadata on the available journals such as authors and titles of articles must be established by the digital library. If there is no cooperation with journal publishers, this metadata must be extracted from the publishers' Web Sites, overcoming the intrinsic heterogeneity problems. Within the framework of the ongoing Natural Sciences Digital Library project at the Free University of Berlin, we have designed a wrapper-mediator mechanism that copes with the heterogeneity problems of automatic metadata acquisition. It is based on our generic HyperView methodology for integration ofWeb Sites. From this methodology it inherits two elegant and effective features. First, the structure of the publisher site is specified with abstract graph-schemata, instead of being hard-coded in scripts for data acquisition. Second, a powerful view concept based on declarative graph-transformation rules is used for information extraction.

#! The Internet provides the opportunity for quickly setting up deals between businesses for promoting each other's products, and to jointly offer new services. Specification and enforcement of such deals stretch traditional transaction processing concepts in several directions since they involve independent businesses with their own internal processes. First, the greater variability in response time in business to business interaction creates a need for asynchronous and event-driven processing, in which correct handling of reissued and cancelled requests is critical. Second, a new transaction processing paradigm is required that supports different views of a unit of business for all participants, i.e., service providers as well as end consumers. Between any two interacting parties, there may be several related interactions dispersed in time, creating a long running conversation. This paper describes our approach (Coyote) to solving these problems including use of a service contract for specifying the rules of interaction across businesses, and directly generating code for enforcement of the contract. We finally describe the architecture and a prototype of a system which implements the Coyote concepts.

These standard interfaces, all of which are implemented in HTTP, support session management, collection discovery and evaluation, metadata searching, metadata retrieval, and online holding retrieval. An XML-based metadata encoding scheme and a simple boolean query language have also been developed. The architecture described by these interfaces has been implemented at UCSB.

#@ Catherine E. Houstis
#t 1998
#c 15
#! We are currently witnessing a proliferation of the Internet, the World Wide Web, and new distributed systems technologies. The idea of federated scientific data repositories, built from organizationally and geographically distributed units, is becoming an area of increasing interest to both scientists and authorities. The general public could benefit from them as well with appropriate access. Such a development would pave the way towards global sharing and combination of environmental information, thereby promoting co-operation among scientists and considerably supporting environmental information management and decision making. From a technical perspective, building federated scientific repositories involves confronting problems such as heterogeneity, distribution, integration, knowledge, authentication, appropriate interfaces and performance. From an organizational perspective it involves Inter-disciplinary co-operation, cross-organizational management, as well as important legal and economic issues. Within the computer science arena solutions exist to each of the technical problems, but their integration is still elusive. Notably, the organizational problems that have to be addressed at the management level may prove far more challenging. So, given that the ingredients exist, how are we to proceed? And will such an effort be worthwhile? In the end shall we save the environment?.

#! In this paper, we describe a scenario for a distributed marketplace on the Web where resource discovery agents find out about resources that may want to join the marketplace and electronic commerce is realized through buying agents representing the customers and the selling agents representing the resources like electronic catalogs. We propose a possible architecture which is based on the emerging technologies and standards. In this architecture, the resources expose their metadata using Resource Description Framework (RDF) to be accessed by the resource discovery agents and their content through Extensible Markup Language (XML) to be accessed by the selling agents by using Document Object Model (DOM). The marketplace contains Document Type Definitions (DTDs) and a dictionary of synonyms to be used by the buying agents to help the customer to specify the item s/he wishes to purchase. Distribution infrastructure is CORBA and Web on which the buying and selling agents find out about each other using Trading Object Services. The modifications necessary to the proposed architecture considering only the available technology are also discussed.

#! This paper presents a new probabilistic model of information retrieval. The most important modeling assumption made is that documents and queries are defined by an ordered sequence of single terms. This assumption is not made in well known existing models of information retrieval, but is essential in the field of statistical natural language processing. Advances already made in statistical natural language processing will be used in this paper to formulate a probabilistic justification for using tf×idf term weighting. The paper shows that the new probabilistic interpretation of tf×idf term weighting might lead to better understanding of statistical ranking mechanisms, for example by explaining how they relate to coordination level ranking. A pilot experiment on the Cranfield test collection indicates that the presented model outperforms the vector space model with classical tf×idf and cosine length normalisation.

It will start with a brief introduction to the way research is organized in Germany, followed by some background on ongoing and completed German projects related to Digital Libraries. Then the approach and organization of the Global-Info program are presented. Global-Info is an interdisciplinary program that includes producers, intermediaries and consumers of scientific information. They are represented by learned societies, publishers, universities, and libraries. The program started at the beginning of this year and will run for a 6-year period with individual project durations of two to three years. A main characteristic of Global-Info is that the more specific goals and its organization will be developed by the scientific community and the publishers - i.e. the funded organizations - in a bottom up process in the course of the program.

#! Electronic commerce is a technology enabled market phenomenon having an increasing impact in how markets are changing. Electronic markets are in a transition characterized by the entrance of strong market players promoting concentration of market activity, and by a slower move, compared to early predictions, towards open electronic markets. Market change has significant impact on the levels, sources and nature of employment. The types of firms that will survive or enter in the emerging market places will affect the sources of employment in the market, while the nature of knowledge and skills required within electronic market places will affect the types of employment that will be offered in the future. This paper provides an understanding regarding future employment conditions by tracing the processes of market change and by providing a detailed explanation of the underlying rationale for these changes. Furthermore, a link has been developed between business transformation phenomena incurred by market change and transformation of the nature and types of work. The analysis model used to discuss specific changes to jobs and skills is applied illustratively to the case of the commerce sector.

#! As individuals and enterprises interconnect via wide area networks, workflows that span them seamlessly will become increasingly valuable. It is likely that heterogeneous participants - humans, applications, organizations - that are physically dispersed over such networks will share workflows that cut across organizational and geographic boundaries. We address the problem of designing a distributed workflow infrastructure that supports such scenarios in the presence of heterogeneous workflow systems and components. We present RainMaker, a workflow framework based on a service requestor/service provider execution model. RainMaker defines a core set of abstract interfaces that can be implemented by distributed workflow components. Together, the RainMaker execution model and interfaces provide a foundation for the interoperability of workflow systems and components.

#! This paper describes novel market-based technologies for systematic, quantifiable and predictable protection of information systems against attacks. These technologies, incorporated in the MarketNet system, use currency to control access to information systems resources and to account for their use. Clients wishing to access a resource must pay in currency acceptable to the domain that owns it. An attacker must thus pay to access the resources used in an attack. Therefore, the opportunities to attack and the damage that can be caused are strictly limited by the budget available to the attacker. A domain can control its exposure to attacks by setting the prices of critical resources and by limiting the currency that it makes available to potential attackers. Currency carries unique identifiers, enabling a domain to pinpoint the sources of attacks. Currency also provides a resource-independent instrumentation to monitor and correlate access patterns and to detect intrusion attacks through automated, uniform statistical analysis of anomalous currency flows. These mechanisms are resource-independent, and admit unlimited scalability for very large systems consisting of federated domains operated by mutually distrustful administrations. They uniquely establish quantifiable and adjustable limits on the power of attackers; enable verifiable accountability for malicious attacks; and admit systematic, uniform monitoring and detection of attacks.

#! In digital libraries accessing distributed Web-based bibliographic repositories, performance is a major issue. Efficient query processing requires an appropriate caching mechanism. Unfortunately, standard page-based as well as tuple-based caching mechanisms designed for conventional databases are not efficient on the Web, where keyword-based querying is often the only way to retrieve data. Therefore, we study the problem of semantic caching of Web queries and develop a caching mechanism for conjunctiveWeb queries based on signature files. We propose two implementation choices. A first algorithm copes with the relation of semantic containment between a query and the corresponding cache items. A second algorithm extends this processing to more complex cases of semantic intersection. We report results of experiments and show how the caching mechanism is successfully realized in the Knowledge Broker system.

#! With the development of large information spaces such as digital libraries, the notion of user navigation through such spaces has gained prominence. The popular view of navigation is that it is a conscious, goal directed activity in which someone is trying to reach a destination. Such a view of navigation is essentially individualistic, objectivist and cognitive. A semiotic analysis of space recognises that there are many different views of space and that space is a subjectively defined concept. There is a context to space which needs to be communicated, negotiated and understood between people. More than just space, there is the idea of place. People produce or construct their places at different times and there is a knock on effect from one place to another. In this paper some implications of taking this different view of information space are explored.

Several spectra of e-commerce are firstly investigated in terms of largely two types of software and its distribution, i.e., shrink-wrapped package software and custom software developed by contract. E-commerce for software is basically service- or process- oriented, in which a brokering service for software packages or components is particular. The architectures of the business-to-business software e-commerce, or the Software CALS, are discussed next. Business, logical, and physical architectures are investigated in terms of their structure and components, services, and data models. Middleware engineering for the UI, communication, and data servers will be one of the most important agenda for the deployment of software e-commerce.

#! In this paper we describe Taiscéalaí, a web-based system which provides content-based retrieval on an up-to-date archive of RTÉ radio news bulletins. Taiscéalaí automatically records and indexes news bulletins twice daily using a stream of phones recognised from the raw audio data. A user's typed query is matched against fixed length windows from the broadcasts. A user interface allows the news bulletins most likely to be relevant to be presented and the user to select sub-parts of the bulletins to be played. Many of the parameters we have chosen to use such as the size and amount of overlap of windows and the weighting of phones within those windows, have been determined within the framework of the TREC Spoken Document Retrieval track and are thus well-founded. We conclude the paper with a walkthrough of a worked example retrieval and an outline of our plans for extending Taiscéalaí into an integrated digital library for news.

#! The electronic processing of cultural heritage information involves stages of acquisition/production, storage, indexing, use/exploitation and transfer. The value of information is compounded by usage and association to other information. It is thus important to ensure the linking of information from disparate sources or held in different systems, access according to multiple viewpoints and needs, and exchange among different systems and user groups. Key issues are the selection of architectures that ensure interoperability and the development of services that support the recording, safeguarding, scientific study and promotion of cultural heritage, including artifacts and information sources. This panel will address these issues with a view towards the shaping of a DL domain.

#! Parallel Text Alignment (PTA) is the problem of automatically aligning content in multiple text documents originating or derived from the same source. The implications of this result in improving multimedia data access in digital library applications range from facilitating the analysis of multiple English language translations of classical texts to enabling the on-demand and random comparison of multiple transcriptions derived from a given audio stream, or associated with a given stream of video, audio, or images. In this paper we give an efficient algorithm for achieving such an alignment, and demonstrate its use with two applications. This result is an application of the new framework of Cross-Modal Information Retrieval recently developed at Dartmouth.

We defined a management architecture for measuring and monitoring the behavior of digital libraries as they operate, so that we can make performance conclusions using real life digital library load. Our architecture can be easily applied on any digital library system, introducing minimal overhead to digital library performance, and requiring minimal changes to the digital library code. We implemented this architecture over a testbed of Dienst servers using real data and workload. We defined the relevant parameters for investigating the performance of the servers and we made visualization tools to study the performance results. We also demonstrated how the performance results can be used by the digital library itself, to produce advanced unattended operations, like load balancing and dynamic timeout adaptation.

#! This paper summarizes the major findings of a University of California study of the Museum Educational Site Licensing Project (MESL) -- the first large-scale multi-institutional image and metadata distribution experiment in the US. The study examined the costs and social impacts of distributing a large body of digital images and metadata from a set of different museums to universities. Among the findings are that the digital distribution environment, as a whole, appears to be good for individual image usage, but is problematic for group viewing situations such as classrooms. Impediments to widespread adoption include: lack of comprehensive content, absence of necessary tools to facilitate use, and inadequate recognition and support for faculty who adopt new technology in their teaching. Other key issues that still need to be addressed include: integration of consortia-provided images and metadata with images acquired elsewhere; allowing instructors to change descriptive information or annotate images; encouraging the creation of added-value tools; and providing particular user interfaces or new integrated tools. The study also compared the cost of digital distribution to the costs of running an analog slide library.

The tools and methods are evaluated with the TREC CLIR task document collection using Dutch queries on the English document base. The main issue addressed here is an evaluation of two approaches to disambiguation. The underlying question is whether a lot of effort should be put in finding the correct translation for each query term before searching, or whether searching with more than one possible translation leads to better results? The experimental study suggests that the quality of search methods is more important than the quality of disambiguation methods. Good retrieval methods are able to disambiguate translated queries implicitly during searching.

In this paper, we propose utilizing a user directed summarization system in an IA setting for helping users to decide about document relevance. The summaries are generated using a sentence extraction method that scores the sentences performing some heuristics employed successfully in previous works (keywords, title and location). User modeling is carried out exploiting user's query to an IA system and expanding query terms using WordNet. We present an objective and systematic evaluation method oriented to measure the summary effectiveness in two IA significant tasks: ad hoc retrieval and relevance feedback. Results obtained prove our initial hypothesis, i.e., user adapted summaries are a useful tool assisting users in an IA context.

#! Resource discovery in a distributed digital library poses many challenges, one of which is how to choose search engines for query distribution, given a query and a set of search engines. This paper focuses on search engine performance as a criterion for search engine selection and defines two measurements of search engine performance: availability - will the search engine respond within a time limit, and response time - how quickly will the search engine respond, given that it responds at all. We predicted both of these performance characteristics with a variety of algorithms, all of which required little computation time and combined past performance data for each search engine into a succinct record. We used operational data from the NCSTRL distributed digital library to make and evaluate predictions, and we found that simple prediction methods performed as well as more complex methods and that prediction accuracy was closely related to data consistency.

#! We propose a query expansion technique which is based on a statistical similarity measure among terms to improve the effectiveness of the dictionary-based cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) method. We employ a term similarity-based sense disambiguation technique proposed in our earlier work to enhance the accuracy of the dictionary-based query translation method. The query expansion technique is then applied to the translation of queries to further improve their retrieval performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the two techniques combined using queries in three languages, namely, German, Spanish, and Indonesian, to retrieve English documents from a standard TREC (Text Retrieval Conference) collection. The results of our experiments indicate that the term similarity-based techniques work better when there are more phrases in the queries. In addition, our results also reemphasize other researchers' finding that phrase recognition and translation are critical to CLIR's effectiveness.

The Webvise open hypermedia system is integrated with the World Wide Web, and has been augmented with a type system. We illustrate the potential use in the context of digital libraries with a scenario of teachers jointly preparing a course based on digital library material.

#! The Web is becoming the universal information space that was envisioned by its inventor, Tim Berners-Lee. To reach its full potential, the Web needs to face two major challenges: Universality and Scalability. Universality means that anybody should be able to access and publish information on the Web. Therefore, the Web should take into account the vast differences in culture, education, ability, material resources, and physical limitations of users on all continents. Scalability means that while millions of services are deployed on the Web, the infrastructure should be able to ensure that performance, trust and relevance keep developing. The talk will present achievements and work in progress at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that address the challenges facing the Web.

They can be used to enable metadata interchange, searching across the Internet or dynamic generation of detailed visual summaries for video browsing. This prototype system has been developed for the State Library of Queensland's (SLQ) Audiovisual unit to enable quick, easy, cost-effective generation of standardized metadata which can be used to create online detailed visual summaries of the latest video acquisitions.

#! We present the Smart Object, Dumb Archive (SODA) model for digital libraries (DLs). The SODA model transfers functionality traditionally associated with archives to the archived objects themselves. We are exploiting this shift of responsibility to facilitate other DL goals, such as interoperability, object intelligence and mobility, and heterogeneity. Objects in a SODA DL negotiate presentation of content and handle their own terms and conditions. In this paper we present implementations of our smart objects, buckets, and our dumb archive (DA). We discuss the status of buckets and DA and how they are used in a variety of DL projects.

#! The rapid expansion of multimedia digital collections brings to the fore the need for classifying not only text documents but their embedded non-textual parts as well. We propose a model for basing classification of multimedia on broad, non-topical features, and show how information on targeted nearby pieces of text can be used to effectively classify photographs on a first such feature, distinguishing between indoor and outdoor images. We examine several variations to a TF*IDF-based approach for this task, empirically analyze their effects, and evaluate our system on a large collection of images from current news newsgroups. In addition, we investigate alternative classification and evaluation methods, and the effect that a secondary feature can have on indoor/outdoor classification. We obtain a classification accuracy of 82%, a number that clearly outperforms baseline estimates and competing image-based approaches and nears the accuracy of humans who perform the same task with access to comparable information.

#! In this article, we present a model of digital audiovisual (AV) library. We describe how AV library users need to be provided not only with accurate and effcient ways to retrieve images and sounds, but also with new environments allowing to read and interpret these images and sounds as AV documents. We show how library users perform an active reading of documents by contextualizing them using corpora of structured meta-information. This documentation consists of documents elaborated from previous readings of this AV content, such as producers' files, critics, etc. It provides a good alternate representation as defined in [34]. We propose a model allowing library users to read AV documents not only along their documentation but from their documentation. This model is based on concepts from the electronic publishing world: it defines different levels of editorial control over the semantics, the structure and the layout of documentation and, in the end, allows the automatic generation of hypermedia applications, which we can be used as a new and efficient AV reading environment by library users. We also describe a prototype implementing parts of this model.

#@ Robert Wilensky
#t 1999

#! Information technology is not merely provided enhanced versions of services of the sort we have come to expect from libraries; it is inducing a fundamental change in the way information is created, disseminated, and used. The shift from the current centralized, discrete publishing model, toward a distributed, continuous, and self-publishing model, is already underway. However, left to its own devices, some of the the better aspects of the current model, such as peer review, may be compromised, even as the opportunity for new services is afforded. Effort will also be required to provide first class support in the emerging infrastructure for data that are not textual in nature, such as images, videos, maps, and scientific data sets. Many tools and technologies will be useful in enhancing and exploiting this view of the emerging information infrastructure. One set of tools relates to document technologies. "Multivalent Documents" is a new model of documents that seems useful in this context. The multivalent document model is (i) highly open, meaning that is supports an open-ended variety of document formats and functions, (ii) highly extensible, meaning that it can be extended and customized in novel ways and to meet particular user needs, and (iii) highly distributed, meaning that components of a document may exist as separate networked resources, which are combined dynamically into a coherent documents. A particularly attractive aspect of the model is the manner in which it supports "spontaneous collaboration", the ability of a user to annotate web pages, scanned images, and other networked, resources for which that user has no privileged relation. Multivalent documents address some issues in manipulating on-line resources. Finding those resources is still problematic, especially for those in image form. "Automatic content analysis" is the set of techniques for analyzing the content of information objects so as to facilitate their subsequent access. We present some recent developments in this area for accessing document images, photographs, and text.

#! In this paper, we describe a crosslingual Information Retrieval System (IRS), which makes the interrogation of multilingual databases possible. Indeed, the CEA needs to be able to process an important amount of multilingual databases and documents, and so we had to adapt the IRS we use, SPIRIT (which relies on linguistical and statistical processing) to this situation. We have thus set up a crosslingual interrogation system based on the indexation of documents containing parts written in different languages and on the bilingual reformulation of the query. The latter tries all the possible translations for every significant word of the query and the documents are used as filters in case of uncertainty or ambiguity. The answers to a query are given in the form of a list of classes of documents ranked according to their relevance. This paper describes the application of these techniques to crosslingual access to catalogs and bibliographic databases.

#! As current digital libraries are becoming more complex, the facilities provided by them will increase and the difficulty of learning associated with the complexity of using these facilities will also increase. In order to produce usable and useful interactive systems, designers need to ensure that good design features are incorporated into the systems, taking into consideration end-users' needs and cultural backgrounds. We carried out a study to investigate useful design features digital libraries should have. The study provides insights on the usability impact of digital libraries for task completion and end-users' perceived impressions on the effectiveness of the digital libraries. The results also suggest that there is little provision on the interface to cater to end-users' browsing and inter-cultural needs. Hence, this paper also discusses design guidelines for the design of user-centred digital libraries.

#! This paper describes the production of an educational multimedia CD-ROM about French rural houses and farms, and how to renovate them without losing their traditional features. The educational message is illustrated with many photographs of non-renovated or renovated houses, and made explicit through comments and descriptions associated with the photos. The paper focuses on the XML metadata describing the photos and the use of this metadata for the automatic generation of Web pages. We first report on the usability of the Dublin Core for interoperable photographs metadata, together with more detailed XML descriptions to support a specific multimedia application. We then show how to generate the Web pages by defining HTML document prescriptions which embed queries to the XML metadata, using Norfolk, a virtual document generator. The approach can be used in various applications ranging from personal virtual photo albums to complex virtual museum.

We describe the design of a digital library server which will enable authors to submit a summary of the contributions they claim their documents makes, and its relations to the literature. We describe a knowledge-based Web environment to support the emergence of such a community-constructed semantic hypertext, and the services it could provide to assist the interpretation of an idea or document in the context of its literature. The discussion considers in detail how the approach addresses usability issues associated with knowledge structuring environments.

This paper briefly describes both organizational and technical issues and approaches involved in creating an operational digital library at the University of Crete, found at http://dlib.libh.uoc.gr. We investigate and describe our approaches and experiences, the last few years, on setting in operation a Digital Library with many collections. We had to analyze the library goals and user needs, to select appropriate software, to make flexible design for the additional functionality needed, to adapt and extend the selected software to make it applicable to the current demands, to install and configure the software, to improve it using feedback, and to interact with document authors and librarians to make the digital library friendly, usable and easily maintainable, and even to collect and digitize the library material. The final system is operated by current library personnel. The main technical issues are related to the design, implementation and application of features of digital libraries, such as multilingual storage and interface, generalization of the software to permit searching on heterogeneous collections, adding support for the Z39.50 protocol and tools that simplify the configuration, administration and data insertion to the digital library, as well as tools to input or modify the metadata and to upload data, when submitting new documents in the digital library.

#! We present an approach to increasing the effectiveness of ranked-output retrieval systems that relies on graphical display and user manipulation of "views" of retrieval results, where a view is the subset of retrieved documents that contain a specified subset of query terms. This approach has been implemented in a system named VIEWER (VIEwing WEb Results), acting as an interface to available search engines. An experimental evaluation of the performance of VIEWER in contrast to AltaVista is the major focus of the paper. We first report the results of an experiment on single, short query searches where VIEWER, used as an interactive ranking system, markedly outperformed AltaVista. We then concentrate on a more realistic searching scenario, involving free query formulation, unconstrained selection of retrieval results, and possibility of query reformulation. We report the results of an experiment where the use of VIEWER, compared to AltaVista, seemed to shift the user effort from inspection to evaluation of results, increasing retrieval effectiveness and user satisfaction. In particular, we found that the VIEWER users retrieved half as many nonrelevant documents as the AltaVista users while retrieving a comparable number of relevant documents.

#! Z39.50 is a client/server protocol widely used in digital libraries and museums for searching and retrieving information spread over a number of heterogeneous sources. To overcome semantic and schematic discrepancies among the various data sources the protocol relies on a world view of information as a flat list of fields, called Access Points (AP). One of the major issues for building Z39.50 wrappers is to map this unstructured list of APs to the underlying source data. Unfortunately, existing Z39.50 wrappers have been developed from scratch and they do not provide high-level mapping languages with veriffiable properties. In this paper, we propose a Description Logic based toolkit for the declarative specification of Z39.50 wrappers. We claim that the conceptualization of AP mappings enables a formal validation of the query translation quality and therefore ensures the quality of the retrieved data. Finally, it allows to tackle a number of Z39.50 pending issues (e.g., metadata retrieval, query failures due to unsupported APs, etc.) by enriching the generated Z39.50 wrappers with a number of added-value services such as conceptual structuring of flat Z39.50 vocabularies and intelligent Z39.50 query assists.

#! Digital Libraries have gained tremendous interest with several research projects addressing the wealth of challenges in this field. While computational intelligence systems are being used for specific tasks in this arena, the majority of projects relies on conventional techniques for the basic structure of the library itself. With the SOMLib project we created a digital library system that uses a neural network-based core for the representation of the library. The self-organizing map, a popular unsupervised neural network model, is used to topically structure a document collection similar to the organization of real-world libraries. Based on this core, additional modules provide information retrieval features, integrate distributed libraries, and automatically label the various topical sections in the document collection. A metaphor graphics based interface further assists the user in intuitively understanding the library providing an instant overview.

#! Music is an important component of digital libraries. This paper discusses a digital music library from the information retrieval viewpoint and proposes a method for extracting theme phrases. These are then used to present a shorter version of retrieved music to users. The method consists of two steps, phrase extraction and syntactical classication of segmented fragments of melodies. Phrase extraction is carried out based on a few heuristic rules. We conducted an experiment on the accuracy of phrase extraction using 94 Japanese popular songs and obtained 0.766 recall and 0.786 precision. The syntactical classification is based on a probabilistic syntactical pattern analysis combining classification and syntactical analysis. The proposed method uses a decision tree and a finite state automaton and obtained 0.884 accuracy in theme phrase extraction.

The Visual Book study [1] explored the importance of the visual component of the book metaphor for the production of more effective electronic books, while the WEB Book study [2] took the findings of the Visual Book and applied them to the production of books for publication on the WWW. Both studies started from an assessment of which kinds of paper book are more suitable for conversion into electronic form, and both identified as target publications those which are meant to be used for reference rather than those which are read sequentially and usually in their entirety by users. This includes scientific publications and textbooks which have been chosen for the Visual Book and the WEB Book experiments. In this paper we discuss the results of the two studies and the way they could influence the design and production of more effective electronic books.

#! Since today more and more complementary information is available in different electronic media there is an increasing demand for the integration of traditional digital library systems and multimedia systems. In this paper we present the OMNIS/2 system, which is an advanced meta system and enhances existing digital library systems or retrieval systems by additional storing and indexing of user-defined multimedia documents, automatic and personal linking concepts, annotations, filtering and personalization. The key concept of OMNIS/2 is that all of the above mentioned features are accomplished without changing the underlying documents. In our architecture existing digital library systems, which are established applications, serve as a document storage layer, while OMNIS/2 forms the multimedia storage layer, linking layer and personalization layer. This general approach ensures the integration and transparent combination of different digital library systems. Thus with OMNIS/2, even mere retrieval systems - and nowadays most digital library systems are mere retrieval systems - can be enriched to interactive multimedia DL-systems and are combined into one virtual personal digital library. OMNIS/2 is part of the Global Inventory Project of the G7 countries.

This paper proposes fuzzy retrieval methods for English text that contains errors in the recognized text without correcting the errors manually. Costs are thereby reduced. The proposed methods generate multiple search terms for each input query term based on probabilistic automata reflecting both error-occurrence probabilities and character-connection probabilities. Experimental results of test-set retrieval indicate that one of the proposed methods improves the recall rate from 95.56% to 97.88% at the cost of a decrease in precision rate from 100.00% to 95.52% with 20 expanded search terms.

#! Interfaces to library systems have largely failed to represent the inherently collaborative nature of information work. This paper describes how collaborative functionality is being implemented as part of the DEBORA project to provide access to digitised Renaissance documents. Work practices of users of Renaissance documents are described and the collaborative features of the client software are outlined. Functionalities discussed include annotation, the creation of virtual books and the inclusion of user-supplied metadata.

#! Literature databases, scientific journals and communication between researchers on the electronic level are rapidly developing tools in mathematics having high impact on the daily work of mathematicians. They improve the availability of information on all important achievements in mathematics, speed up the publication and communication procedures and lead to enhanced facilities for the preparation and presentation of research in mathematics. The aim of this article is to give a more detailed report on one of these projects, the so-called EULER-project, developing a search engine for distributed mathematical sources in the web. Main features of the EULER deliveries are uniform access of different sources, high precision of information, deduplication facilities, user-friendliness and an open approach enabling participation of additional resources. The partner of the projects represent different types of libraries and moreover different types of information in the web. The functionalities of the EULER-engine will be described and a report will be given on the transition from the prototype developed in the project to a consortium based service in the internet.

#! Transaction logs are invaluable sources of fine-grained information about users' search behavior. This paper compares the searching behavior of users across two WWW-accessible digital libraries: the New Zealand Digital Library's Computer Science Technical Reports collection (CSTR), and the Karlsruhe Computer Science Bibliographies (CSBIB) collection. Since the two collections are designed to support the same type of users-researchers/students in computer science-a comparative log analysis is likely to uncover common searching preferences for that user group. The two collections differ in their content, however; the CSTR indexes a full text collection, while the CSBIB is primarily a bibliographic database. Differences in searching behavior between the two systems may indicate the effect of differing search facilities and content type.

#! Rooted in the principle of hypertext, linked information is almost ubiquitous due to the WWW and related services. Links between information objects are established for various reasons, aspects of which are encoded by a link type or expressed through link context, e.g., by the surrounding content. Such reasons may lose their validity through content evolution in the link target. Fine-grained solutions are required that enable the user to gain evolution awareness without being distracted from his main task. In this paper we present aging links as a non-intrusive mechanism for improving awareness in cooperative work with linked information networks. A link may age, affected by the evolution of the link target, leading to a gradual loss of its validity. The aging process is driven by evolution-indicating events and may be flexibly controlled by link type specific aging strategies. A customizable service, EvEnAge, based on standard technologies, prototypically implements the concept of aging links for XML documents.

#* Functional and Intentional Limitations of Interactivity on Content Indexing Topics: Possible Uses of Automatic Classification and Contents Extraction Systems, in Order to Create Digital Libraries Databases
#@ Florent Pasquier
#t 2000
#c 15
#! The context of the creation of self-learning contents knows a revolution by the use of digital tools. The process to realize video was based previously on the use of analog tools. It moves nowadays towards digital ones: studios are equipped to work with digital data and digital materials under the pressure of international standards and components. On the same time, capture and storage pictures by videotapes evolve towards hybrid supports (Digital/Video), which will become entirely digital soon (computers hard-discs and networks). The current creation process which uses a kind of simulated interactivity, waits new materials and synopsis that will allow a true and complete interactivity. This interactivity needs to be used through a full digital multimedia way. The current evolution of the market digital systems seems to empower the role of the creator and the designer. They might start their creation with previous and genuine videos, by exploiting the ones which suit the best what they need, picking them up on video databases. But the problem is to be able to locate the video wanted. Many systems of automatic recognition (voice, pictures, videos...) are already functional to help them in this heavy task. But the question of using them in a relevant context, as the educational one per example, is still not resolved.

#! We tackle two different problems of text categorization (TC), namely feature selection and classifier induction. Feature selection (FS) refers to the activity of selecting, from the set of r distinct features (i.e. words) occurring in the collection, the subset of r′ ≪ r features that are most useful for compactly representing the meaning of the documents. We propose a novel FS technique, based on a simplified variant of the X2 statistics. Classifier induction refers instead to the problem of automatically building a text classifier by learning from a set of documents pre-classified under the categories of interest. We propose a novel variant, based on the exploitation of negative evidence, of the well-known k-NN method. We report the results of systematic experimentation of these two methods performed on the standard REUTERS-21578 benchmark.

Based on a metadata schema, generated using the ABC model, we developed indexing tools, a database and a search and browse Web interface, for an oral history collection consisting of audio tapes and posters generated from a series of interviews and photographs. The objective was to build a test-bed to test and refine the ABC model and also to demonstrate that use of the model will ensure consistent, well-structured, unambiguous metadata descriptions for complex multimedia collections. Such descriptions will hopefully lead to improved fine-grained resource discovery, interoperability between different metadata schemes and explicit tracking of intellectual property rights.

#! Most information systems, which perform computerized searches of textual databases, deal with the need to display a list of documents which fulfill the search criteria. The user must chose from a list of documents, those documents which are relevant to his search query. Selection of the relevant document is problematical, especially during searches of large databases which have a large number of documents fulfilling the search criteria. This article defines a new hierarchical tree which is made up of three levels of display of search results. In a series of previous studies (not yet published) which were carried out at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, the influence of information (within the documents) displayed to the user was examined in the framework of a list of responses to questions regarding user satisfaction with the method and the quality of his choices. In the present study, in addition to the information displayed in the list, information on the contents (subject) of the document was also displayed. The study examined the influence of this additional information on search time, user satisfaction and ease of using the systems.

#! In digital libraries, nearest-neighbor search (NN-search) plays a key role for content-based retrieval over multimedia objects. However, performance of existing NN-search techniques is not satisfactory with large collections and with high-dimensional representations of the objects. To obtain response times that are interactive, we pursue the following approach: it uses a linear algorithm that works with approximations of the vectors and parallelizes it. In more detail, we parallelize NN-search based on the VA-File in a Network of Workstations (NOW). This approach reduces search time to a reasonable level for large collections. The best speedup we have observed is by almost 30 for a NOW with only three components with 900 MB of feature data. But this requires a number of design decisions, in particular when taking load dynamism and heterogeneity of components into account. Our contribution is to address these design issues.

With novel digitising techniques is now possible to have these books stored in digital format and accessible to a wider public. However it remains the problem of how to use them. DEBORA (Digital accEss to BOoks of the RenAissance) is a European project that aims to develop a system to interact with these books through world-wide networks. The main issue is to build a database accessible through client computers. That will require to built accompanying metadata that should characterise different components of the books as illuminated letters, banners, figures and key words in order to simplify and speed up the remote access. To solve these problems, digital image analysis algorithms regarding filtering, segmentation, separation of text from non-text, lines and word segmentation and word recognition were developed. Some novel ideas are presented and illustrated through examples.

Customer users can search in data sources from a variety of suppliers for articles of journals and order specific pages of the articles. Their search can also include electronic journals in which case their orders can be fulfilled, charged and delivered electronically as an e-mail attachment without needing an operator. The various suppliers can view orders made to them and service them. A customer can direct his order to several suppliers declaring an order of preference. We also introduce the issues involved and present our open system solution that separates the search from the order procedures. Searching can use any external interface provided by the various data sources and intercepts queries and their answers to search requests.

These three tiers cover some of the most promising access methods for digital libraries.

The gatherer creates RDF metadata descriptions of collected resources. Before delivering the data to the retrieval engine, the RDF is transformed into valid XML. The query language supported by the retrieval engine is an extension of XQL with weighting and data types with vague predicates. The user interface provides for browsing as well as simple searching.

Hence to improve the availability of the classical publications in that area and to enable to get quick information on these, electronic literature information services and digital archives of the complete texts will be needed as important tools for the mathematical research in the future. This will bring the holdings from the journals archives nearer to the user and will prevent lost of the papers because of the deterioration of the paper as a consequence of age. The aim of this article is to give a more detailed report of a project, the so-called ERAM project, capturing the "Jahrbuch" as a classical bibliographic service in mathematics in a database and using this activity to select important publications from the Jahrbuch period for digitisation and storage in a digital archive. The database will not be just a copy of the printed bibliography. It will contain a lot of enhancements like modern subject classifications as far as possible, keywords giving ideas about the content in modern terms and comments relating classical results to modern mathematical research areas. These features will remain open for additions within a living project. The digital archive built up in connection with the database will be linked to the database and provide all facilities associated with current digitisation projects. The content will be distributed to mirrors and combined with similar archiving activities in mathematics.

The adoption of meta search techniques for web-collections is hindered by the enormous heterogeneity of the resources. In this paper we introduce QUEST -- a system for querying specialized collections on the web. One focus of QUEST is to unify search fields from different collections by relating the search concepts to each other in a concept-taxonomy. To identify the most relevant collections according to a user query, we propose an association-based strategy. Furthermore the Frankurt Core is introduced--a metadata-scheme for describing web-collections as a whole. Its fields are filled automatically by a metadata-collector component. Finally a prototype of QUEST is presented, demonstrating the integration of the techniques in an overall architecture.

Navigating between these news sources to find stories of interest can be time consuming and inefficient. These multiple stories can be combined into personalised news packages by selecting items on topics of interest to an individual user. The appropriate contents of these personalised news packages can be determined by a combination of information retrieval techniques and explicit user preferences.

These systems were designed to be high performance, large scale systems, capable of supporting very large, multimedia databases, accessible to large numbers of simultaneous users. Using this experience, the staff set out to design a digital library system that could satisfy the needs of small libraries. A small digital library system cannot be simply a scaled back version of a large system. The primary factors driving the design of a small system are cost, scalability and technical support. The resulting digital library system, named MADILIS, is designed to satisfy all of the criteria for a fully functional digital library system, while also meeting the cost, scalability and technical support needs of small libraries.

#! Due the cursive nature of the Arabic scripts automatic recognition of keywords using computers is very difficult. Content based indexing using textual, graphical and visual information combined provides a more realistic and practical approach to the problem of indexing large collection of calligraphic material. Starting with low level patter recognition and feature extraction techniques, graphical representations of the calligraphic material can be captured to form the low level indexing parameters. These parameters are then enhanced using textual and visual information provided by the users. Through visual feedback and visual interaction, recognized textual information can be used to enhance the indexing parameter and in return improve the retrieval of the calligraphic material. In this paper, we report an implementation of the system and show how visual feedback and visual interaction helps to improve the indexing parameters created using the low-level image feature extraction technologies.

The technological orientation of the university and a robust network infrastructure have made it possible for Drexel to make this transition more quickly than most, if not all, U.S. academic libraries. Shifts in costs occur in all budget areas: capital (space and network infrastructure), staffing, purchased services, materials, supplies and equipment. Overall, costs are higher, but preliminary data indicates that in Drexel's case per journal and per article costs are lower.

These include frequent content change as well as the rate at which Web documents are removed or moved by their authors or creators. There have been a number of author-side and cataloger-side initiatives to assist in the management of Web documents, but these do not adequately address change. This paper explores some of those options. It addresses the impact of document change and demise on digital and hybrid collections. It offers suggestions on the management of the change and demise phenomena.

#! The OASIS (Ontologically Augmented Spatial Information System) project explores terminology systems for thematic and spatial access in digital library applications. A prototype implementation uses data from the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland, together with the Getty AAT and TGN thesauri. This paper describes its integrated spatial and thematic schema and discusses novel approaches to the application of thesauri in spatial and thematic semantic distance measures. Semantic distance measures can underpin interactive and automatic query expansion techniques by ranking lists of candidate terms. We first illustrate how hierarchical spatial relationships can be used to provide more flexible retrieval for queries incorporating place names in applications employing online gazetteers and geographical thesauri. We then employ a set of experimental scenarios to investigate key issues affecting use of the associative (RT) thesaurus relationships in semantic distance measures. Previous work has noted the potential of RTs in thesaurus search aids but the problem of increased noise in result sets has been emphasised. Specialising RTs allows the possibility of dynamically linking RT type to query context. Results presented in this paper demonstrate the potential for filtering on the context of the RT link and on subtypes of RT relationships.

#! NCSTRL (The Networked Computer Science Technical Report Library) is a successful digital library for scientific and technical information. It uses the Dienst protocol that was developed by ARPA-funded CS-TR project. We encountered several problems while implementing NCSTRL based large-scale libraries: UPS for Los Alamos and JDL for JTASC. The document collection for these libraries can range from several hundred thousands to few millions. The first problem we found that the native Dienst implementation does not scale beyond approximately 30,000 records. Secondly we found that the implementation is tightly coupled to the Unix platform. Finally, for a large number of hits the NCSTRL search interface support is limited in terms of usability. To address these problems, we replaced the Dienst repository service implementation with an Oracle-based implementation using servlet technology. The Oracle database stores the index information (metadata) and is partitioned horizontally to speed searching through different archives. Furthermore, indexes were built in order to speed the search by different key items such as the author name, the title and the abstract. Our implementation significantly reduced the average wait time for a user for searches that resulted in a large number of hits. In addition, we get all the other benefits of using servlet technology such as efficiency and portability. In this paper, we present the performance results of the new implementation and compare it with that of the implementation of the Dienst protocol in NCSTRL.

The six interfaces are implemented on top of Físchlár, an operational recording, indexing, browsing and playback system for broadcast TV programmes. In developing the six browsing interfaces, we have been informed by the various dimensions which can be used to distinguish one interface from another. For this we include layeredness (the number of "layers" of abstraction which can be used in browsing a programme), the provision or omission of temporal information (varying from full timestamp information to nothing at all on time) and visualisation of spatial vs. temporal aspects of the video. After introducing and defining these dimensions we then locate some common browsing interfaces from the literature in this 3-dimensional "space" and then we locate our own six interfaces in this same space. We then present an outline of the interfaces and include some user feedback.

We formulate the segmentation problem as an optimisation problem and adopt evolutionary strategy of Genetic Algorithms (GA) for the clustering of small regions in colour feature space. The present approach uses k-Means unsupervised clustering methods into GA, namely for guiding this last Evolutionary Algorithm in his search for finding the optimal or sub-optimal data partition, task that as we know, requires a non-trivial search because of its intrinsic NP-complete nature. To solve this task, the appropriate genetic coding is also discussed, since this is a key aspect in the implementation. Our purpose is to demonstrate the efficiency of GA to automatic and unsupervised texture segmentation. Some examples in Colour Maps are presented and overall results discussed.

The results highlight that although these resources appear to be a relatively innocuous means of information provision (i.e. no sensitive data) social and organisational issues can impede effective technology deployment. Clinical social structures, which produce information - and technology - hoarding behaviours can result from poor training, support and DL usability.

For each of these dimensions, we describe the major attributes. Using this scheme, existing DL test beds can be characterised. For this purpose, we have performed a survey by means of a questionnaire, which is now continued by setting up a DL meta-library.

#! Federated digital libraries are composed of distributed, autonomous, and often heterogeneous information services but provide users with a transparent, integrated view of collected information. In this paper we discuss a federated system for the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD), an international consortium of universities, libraries, and other supporting institutions focused on electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs). Federation requires dealing flexibly with differences among systems, ontologies, and data formats while respecting information sources' autonomy. Our solution involves adapting the object-oriented digital library system MARIAN to serve as mediation middleware for the federated NDLTD collection. Components of the solution include: 1) the use and integration of several harvesting techniques; 2) an architecture based on object-oriented ontologies of search modules and metadata; 3) reconciliation of diversity within the harvested data joined to a single collection view for the user; and 4) an integrated framework for addressing such questions as data quality, flexible and efficient search, and scalability.

#! Multi-lingual information resources that consist of texts in more scripts than can be represented by a single 8-bit encoding scheme can currently be best represented by use of the Unicode multi-byte character-encoding scheme. However use of Unicode could lead to a decrease in the accuracy of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software because of the similarity of glyphs between certain scripts. This decrease in OCR accuracy can dramatically increase the amount of time needed to proofread the resulting electronic texts. An Indiana University - Digital Library Program project for digitizing a 20-year portion of the Letopis' Zhurnal'nykh Statei is presented as an example of a digital library project dealing with a multi-script information resource for which Unicode has been used.

#* Building and Indexing a Distributed Multimedia Presentation Archive Using SMIL

#% 286955
#! This paper proposes an approach to the problem of generating metadata for composite mixed-media digital objects by appropriately combining and exploiting existing knowledge or metadata associated with the individual atomic components which comprise the composite object. Using a distributed collection of multimedia learning objects, we test this proposal by investigating mechanisms for capturing, indexing, searching and delivering digital online presentations using SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language). A set of tools have been developed to automate and streamline the construction and fine-grained indexing of a distributed library of digital multimedia presentation objects by applying SMIL to lecture content from both the University of Qld and Cornell University. Using temporal information which is captured automatically at the time of lecture delivery, the system can automatically synchronize the video of a lecture with the corresponding Powerpoint slides to generate a finely-indexed presentation at minimum cost and effort. This approach enables users to search and retrieve relevant streaming video segments of the lecture based on keyword or free text searches within the slide content. The underlying metadata schema, the metadata processing/generation tools, distributed archive, backend database and the search, browse and playback interfaces which comprise the system are also described in this paper. We believe that the relatively low cost and high speed of development of this apparently sophisticated multimedia archive with rich search capabilities, provides evidence to support the validity of our initial proposal.

The Cornell Digital Library Research Group employs value-added surrogates as a generalizable mechanism for providing reference-linking behavior in Web documents. This mechanism exposes reference linking data through a well-defined API, permitting the construction of reference linking services by external clients. We present two example reference linking applications buildable on this API. We also introduce a performance metric; currently we are (automatically) extracting reference linking information with more than 80% accuracy.

#! Data streams are very important sources of information for both researchers and other users. Data streams might be video or audio streams or streams of sensor readings or satellite images. Using digital libraries for archival, preservation, administration, and access control for this type of information greatly enhances the utility of data streams. For this specific type of digital libraries, our proposed event-based retrieval provides an alternate, yet a very natural way of retrieving information. People tend to remember or search by a specific event that occurred in the stream better than by the time at which this event occurred. In this paper we present the analysis and design of a digital library system that contains data streams and supports event-based retrieval.

#! The cultural heritage domain dealing with digital surrogates of rare and fragile historic artifacts is one of the most promising areas for establishing collaboratories, i.e. shared virtual working environments for groups of users. However, in order to be considered a useful tool, such a system must reflect and support the specific tasks which are typical for the domain. The system design presented here takes into account a variety of activities, e.g., source analysis, which are supported by a task-specific selection of appropriate retrieval functions, e.g., access to OCR results and annotations. The tasks are explicitly modeled, thus the corresponding user interfaces can be automatically generated.

#! A browsing interface to a document collection can be constructed automatically by identifying the phrases that recur in the full text of the documents and structuring them into a hierarchy based on lexical inclusion. This provides a good way of allowing readers to browse comfortably through the phrases (all phrases) in a large document collection. A subject-oriented thesaurus provides a different kind of hierarchical structure, based on deep knowledge of the subject area. If all documents, or parts of documents, are tagged with thesaurus terms, this provides a very convenient way of browsing through a collection. Unfortunately, manual classification is expensive and infeasible for many practical document collections. This paper describes a browsing scheme that gives the best of both worlds by providing a phrase-oriented browser and a thesaurus browser within the same interface. Users can switch smoothly between the phrases in the collection, which give access to the actual documents, and the thesaurus entries, which suggest new relationships and new terms to seek.

#* Open Archive Initiative, Publishers and Scientific Societies: Future of Publishing - Next Generation Publishing Models

#! This panel will look into the future of publishing as a process between authoring communities such as scientific associations and publishers, i.e., non profit organizations on the one hand, and commercial enterprizes responsible for performing the production, marketing, sales and distribution of publications on the other hand. Just recently and especially triggered by the activities of, for example the Open Archive Initiative and other similar movements, the discussion between the different stake holders in the scientific publishing process has become more intensive. It is generally questioned whether the traditional publishing models are still valid since the advent of electronic publishing tools enable publishing from the desktop, and public distribution mechanisms like the web enable distribution at virtually no cost. These developments have produced a totally different scenario from the past. In this context the passing of intellectual property rights from authors to publishing companies is questioned in the same way as the validity of traditional business models, pricing policies, and access regulations. On the other hand, issues like quality assurance etc. and the cost of high quality production, distribution, and maintenance of intellectual collections cannot be neglected. The members of the panel are exemplary representatives of the different stakeholders in the scientific publishing process and will report on what has been achieved so far in the discussion and on still open questions. Their presentations will include their view on which agreements have to be achieved in the future for organizing and supporting the scientific publishing process in a fair way, at the same time paving the ground for organizational innovation in other areas of publication.

We report on the first two years of a five-year project to design and evaluate the Alexandria Digital Earth ProtoType (ADEPT), a digital library of geo-referenced information resources, for use in undergraduate education. To date, we have established design principles, observed classroom activities, gathered baseline data from instructors and students, and evaluated early prototypes. While students and instructors are generally enthusiastic about ADEPT, they have concerns about the effort required and the effectiveness of computer-based technologies in the classroom. Instructors vary widely in their use of instructional materials and technologies, teaching styles, and areas of expertise. Results of our work are being incorporated in an iterative cycle of design and evaluation. The paper concludes by presenting research and evaluation methods, design principles, and requirements for educational applications of digital libraries.

Despite the fact that many Digital Libraries (DLs) are available on the Internet, users cannot effectively use them because of inadequate functionality, deficient visualization and insufficient integration of different DLs. As part of the DAFFODIL1 project we develop a user-oriented access system for DLs which overcomes these drawbacks. A major focus of the prototype concerns the implementation of search stratagems that exhaust the data structures stored in federated bibliographic DLs. The paper introduces stratagems taking into account information on the (social) status of scientific actors in author networks using network analysis methods. To make the propagation and analysis of actor networks more efficient an optimization strategy called main path analysis is employed.

#! With the rapid development of on-line information services, information technologies for on-line information processing have been receiving much attention recently. Clustering plays important roles in various on-line applications such as extraction of useful information from news feeding services and selection of relevant documents from the incoming scientific articles in digital libraries. In on-line environments, users generally have interests on newer documents than older ones and have no interests on obsolete old documents. Based on this observation, we propose an on-line document clustering method F2ICM (Forgetting-Factor-based Incremental Clustering Method) that incorporates the notion of a forgetting factor to calculate document similarities. The idea is that every document gradually losses its weight (or memory) as time passes according to this factor. Since F2ICM generates clusters using a document similarity measure based on the forgetting factor, newer documents have much effects on the resulting cluster structure than older ones. In this paper, we present the fundamental idea of the F2ICM method and describe its details such as the similarity measure and the clustering algorithm. Also, we show an efficient incremental statistics maintenance method of F2ICM which is indispensable for on-line dynamic environments.

#! DWE is aimed at providing a one-stop access point to local and remote digital library collections, traditional in-house libraries, and most importantly, to the vast array of information resources that exists in the academic community's local Intranet. Due to vast amount of information available and the difficulty faced by students and staff in finding the relevant resources, there is a need for a better and logical organization of these resources. DWE uses tasks as a means of directing students and staff to the relevant resources. Tasks generally play an important role in system and user interface design. Identifying the user's tasks enables the designer to construct user interfaces reflecting the tasks' properties, including efficient usage patterns, easy-to-use interaction sequences, and powerful assistance features. The resources in DWE are organized according to specific tasks performed by the research students and staff in the division of information studies. The tasks and resources were elicited based on the needs of faculty and students through interviews and focus groups.

#* Digital Watermark
#@ Hamid Reza Mehrabi
#t 2001

#! Cultural institutions have an increasing need for protection of copyright on the internet. Digital images are easily downloaded and thus need to be protected from misuse. This project will develop a method for provision of protection. An invisible signal, known as a digital watermark, is a mark placed on a still image. In a project Culture Net Denmark at The Royal library in Copenhagen a method for copyright protection of digital colour images is analysed and implemented. The signature bits are embedded by modifying the blue channel in the image. A generator that produces random locations in the image, where the signatures bits are embedded, is chosen to prevent any removal of the signature. Specifically, a secret key determines where the signatures bits are embedded in the image. To extract the signature a user needs to know the secret key. Furthermore, a method is implemented to retrieve the signature without reference to the original image. The robustness of the method against possible attacks via geometrical transformation or filtering is analysed.

In building and using these information spaces there is a need for technology to express, navigate and manage relationships. This paper presents the DL-LinkService, an object-oriented solution for structuring information in digital libraries where the relationships are implemented as distributed objects. The service is inspired by the CORBA Relationship Service, but our contribution is more flexible because the typing of relationships is independent of the implementation of the service. This paper describes the DL-LinkService and its possible use in three scenarios. A prototype is developed and our experience with the DL-LinkService is that this is a promising solution for expressing and navigating the structural information of digital libraries.

The quality-controlled merging of RCNs integrates the contributions from different authors, fostering synergies and the achievement of common goals. The C-Merge tool design is based on a generalized view of the merge process and a simple but flexible model of RCNs. The tool is policy-driven and supports a variable degree of automation. Powerful options for user interaction and expressive change visualization enable substantial user support as well as effective quality control for the merge process.

#! We are experiencing a tremendous increase in the amount of music being made available in digital form. With the creation of large multimedia collections, however, we need to devise ways to make those collections accessible to the users. While music repositories exist today, they mostly limit access to their content to query-based retrieval of their items based on textual meta-information, with some advanced systems supporting acoustic queries. What we would like to have additionally, is a way to facilitate exploration of musical libraries. We thus need to automatically organize music according to its sound characteristics in such a way that we find similar pieces of music grouped together, allowing us to find a classical section, or a hard-rock section etc. in a music repository. In this paper we present an approach to obtain such an organization of music data based on an extension to our SOMLib digital library system for text documents. Particularly, we employ the Self-Organizing Map to create a map of a musical archive, where pieces of music with similar sound characteristics are organized next to each other on the two-dimensional map display. Locating a piece of music on the map then leaves you with related music next to it, allowing intuitive exploration of a music archive.

#! Digital preservation is a pressing challenge to the library community. In this paper, we describe the initial results of our efforts towards understanding digital (as well as traditional) preservation problems from first principles. Our approach is to use the language of mathematics to formalize the concepts that are relevant to preservation. Our theory of preservation spaces draws upon ideas from logic and programming language semantics to describe the relationship between concrete objects and their information contents. We also draw on game theory to show how objects change over time as a result of uncontrollable environment effects and directed preservation actions. In the second half of this paper, we show how to use the mathematics of universal algebra as a language for objects whose information content depends on many components. We use this language to describe both migration and emulation strategies for digital preservation.

Automatic methods for mappings between different ontologies are necessary to ensure successful retrieval of information stored in virtual digital libraries. Text categorization has discussed learning methods to map between full text terms and thesaurus descriptors. This article reports some experiments for the mapping between different ontologies and shows further that fusion methods which have been successfully applied to ad-hoc information retrieval can also be employed for text categorization.

In this paper we use dynamic expert groups which are automatically formed to recommend domain-specific documents for unspecified users. The group members have dynamic authority weights depending on their performance of the ranking evaluations. Human evaluations over web pages are very effective to find relevant information in a specific domain. In addition, we have tested several effectiveness measures on rank order to determine if the current top-ranked lists recommended by experts are reliable. We show simulation results to check the possibility of dynamic expert group models for recommender systems.

#! Similar to a conventional museum, a digital museum draws a set of objects from its collection of digital artifacts to produce exhibitions about a specific topic. Online exhibitions often consist of a variety of multimedia objects such as webpages, animation, and video clips. In a physical museum, the exhibition is confined by the physical limitation of the artifacts. That is, there can only be one exhibition using the same set of artifacts. Thus, if one wishes to design different exhibitions about the same topic for different user groups, one has to use different sets of artifacts, and exhibit them in different physical locations. A digital museum does not have such physical restrictions. One can design different exhibitions about the same topic for adults, children, experts, novices, high bandwidth users, and low bandwidth users, all using the same set of digital artifacts. A user can simply click and choose the specific style of exhibition that she wants to explore. The difficulty here is that it is time-consuming to produce illustrative and intriguing online exhibitions. One can spend hours designing webpages for just one exhibition alone, not to mention several. In this paper, we present the design of an XSL-based Multi-Presentation Content Management System (XMP-CMS). This framework is a novel approach for organizing digital collections, and for quickly selecting, integrating, and composing objects from the collection to produce exhibitions of different presentation styles, one for each user group. A prototype based on our framework has been implemented and successfully used in the production of a Lanyu digital museum. Using our method, the Lanyu Digital Museum online exhibition has several features: (1) It provides an easy way to compose artifacts extracted from the digital collection into exhibitions. (2) It provides an easy way to create different presentations of the same exhibition content that are catered to users with different needs. (3) It provides easy-to-use film-editing capability to re-arrange an exhibition and to produce new exhibitions from existing ones.

#! We compare the usage of a Digital Library with many different categories of collections, by examining its log files for a period of twenty months, and we conclude that the access points that the users mostly refer to, depend heavily on the type of content of the collection, the detail of the existing meta-data and the target user group. We also found that most users tend to use simple query structures (e.g. only one search term) and very few and primitive operations to accomplish their request. Furthermore, as they get more experienced, they reduce the number of operations in their sessions.

#! This paper describes the motivation and the method that we used for aligning digital spoken books, and the results obtained both at a word level and at a phone level. This alignment will allow specific access interfaces for persons with special needs, and also tools for easily detecting and indexing units (words, sentences, topics) in the spoken books. The tool was implemented in a Weighted Finite State Transducer framework, which provides an efficient way to combine different types of knowledge sources, such as alternative pronunciation rules. With this tool, a 2-hour long spoken book was aligned in a single step in much less than real time.

#! The unique heritage of the Alinari collections gives life to one of the biggest international centers of photographic and iconographic documentation with over 3.5 million vintage images from the 19the and 20the century from all over the world.Today Alinari is a modern reality operating in the wider field of image and communication: a brand name which guarantees an age-old fund of experience combined with state-of-the-art technological skills. A good example of this sinergy is given in the REGNET project, which aims to set up a functional network of service centres in Europe which provides IT-services dedicated to Cultural Heritage organisations and will be an enabler of eBusiness activities for CH organizations. Multi media industries enabling the production of electronic publications will be integrated. It will provide access and use of digital data (scientific and cultural) as well as of physical goods as provided by museum shops.

The Technical Report Interchange project is a cooperative experimental effort between NASA Langley ResearchCen ter, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Air Force Research Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratory and Old Dominion University to allow for the integration of technical reports. This is accomplished using the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) and having each site cache the metadata from the other participating sites. Each site also implements additional software to ingest the OAI-PMH harvested meta-data into their native digital library (DL). This allows the users at each site to see an increased technical report collection through the familiar DL interfaces and take advantage of whatever valued added services are provided by the native DL.

#! The rapid increase in content available in digital forms gives rise to large digital libraries, targeted to support millions of users and terabytes of data. Efficiently retrieving information then is a challenging task due to the size of the collection and its index. In this paper, our high performance "hybrid" partition inverted index is validated through experiments with a 100 Gbyte collection from TREC-9 and -10. The hybrid scheme combines the term and the document approaches to partitioning inverted indices across nodes of a parallel system. Experiments on a parallel system show that this organization outperforms the document and the term partitioning schemes. Our hybrid approach should support highly efficient searching for information in a large-scale digital library, implemented atop a network of computers.

#! Recordings of audio-visual presentations are a potentially valuable component of digital libraries. These recordings can be archived to enable remote access to audio presentations including lectures and seminars. Recordings of presentations often contain multiple information streams involving visual and audio data. If the full benefit of these recordings is to be realised these multiple media streams must be properly integrated to enable rapid navigation. This paper describes the application of information retrieval techniques within a system to automatically synchronise an audio soundtrack with electronic slides from a presentation. A novel component of the system is the detection of sections of the presentation unsupported by prepared slides, such as discussion and question answering, and automatic development of keypoint slides for these elements of the presentation.

The Information Retrieval from Mixed-Media Collections (IRMMC) project is investigating retrieval from combined document collections composed of items originating from differing media forms. Experimentalin vestigation of a "mixed-media" retrieval task based on the existing TREC Spoken Document Retrievaltask combining Text, Spoken and Scanned Image is described. Results show that nontext media perform well within the mixed-media collection. Also while pseudo relevance feedback is extremely effective for spoken documents, its behaviour for document image retrievalis more complex.

#! In this paper, we address the issue of interactive search results manipulation, as provided by typical Web-based information retrieval modules like search engines and directories. Many digital library systems could benefit a lot from the proposed approach, since it is heavily based on metadata, which constitute the building block of such systems. We also propose a way of ranking search results according to their overall importance, which is defined as a weighted combination of the relevancy and popularity of a resource that is being referenced in a search results list. In order to evaluate this model, we have developed an interactive search results manipulation application, which is executed at the client's workspace through a Web browser without any further interaction with the server that provided the initial search results list. The prototype implementation is based on the XML standard and has been evaluated through an adequate evaluation process from which useful conclusions have been obtained.

#! Advanced information technology has changed our society in various aspects. University libraries are also changing with the adoption of advanced information technology. Specifically, digital technology including the Internet has changed traditional university libraries in their operations as well as infrastructures. Traditional university libraries have stored and distributed scholarly information in printed media. However, most of current university libraries are hybrid libraries, which are dependent on digital media as well as printed media, and are based on both network facilities and physical facilities. The evaluation metrics developed for traditional university libraries are no longer adequate to evaluate current university libraries. This paper presents an evaluation of hybrid libraries. Based on the opinions of library experts and the previous works on the evaluation of both traditional and digital libraries, an initial evaluation model was developed, which consists of 8 categories, 33 items, and 84 indicators. The Delphi method was then applied to develop a valid evaluation model for university libraries. A survey was conducted 3 times for 50 balanced subjects among library-related professors, researchers, and senior university librarians. Based on the surveys' results, the categories, items, and indicators were modified to derive the new evaluation model, which consists of 7 evaluation categories, 35 items, and 92 indicators. The content validity of this model was confirmed through the survey results of 184 university librarians.

#! Crawling the Web to build collections of documents related to pre-specified topics became an active area of research during the late 1990's, crawler technology having been developed for use by search engines. Now, Web crawling is being seriously considered as an important strategy for building large scale digital libraries. This paper covers some of the crawl technologies that might be exploited for collection building. For example, to make such collection-building crawls more effective, focused crawling was developed, in which the goal was to make a "best-first" crawl of the Web. We are using powerful crawler software to implement a focused crawl but use tunneling to overcome some of the limitations of a pure best-first approach. Tunneling has been described by others as not only prioritizing links from pages according to the page's relevance score, but also estimating the value of each link and prioritizing them as well. We add to this mix by devising a tunneling focused crawling strategy which evaluates the current crawl direction on the fly to determine when to terminate a tunneling activity. Results indicate that a combination of focused crawling and tunneling could be an effective tool for building digital libraries.

#! An electronic book means a digital form of a paper book. Currently, to promote an eBook market, many countries have established eBook content standards. But, the publication of different caused exchanging problems due to mismatch of content forms. Therefore, to exchange eBook conforming each standard, the content has to be converted according to document structure and its semantic information. But existing conversion methods are almost based on syntax information. Even, using semantic information they are not reflected eBook characteristics. So, to precise and correct eBook conversion, we analyze each standard and define mapping relations considering semantic information and eBook characteristics. To generalize the mapping relations, we classify mapping relations into ten conversion classes, and provide conversion scripts examples for each class. With defined mapping relations and conversion classes, we write up conversion scripts for EBKS to OEB PS/JepaX, and experiment with them. We believe defined conversion classes can be applied to normal document conversions.

#! DAFFODIL is a digital library system targeting at strategic support during the information search process. For the user, mainly high-level search functions, so-called stratagems, implement this strategic support, which provide functionality beyond today's digital libraries. Through the tight integration of stratagems and with the federation of heterogeneous digital libraries, DAFFODIL reaches a high synergy effect for information and services. These effects provide high-quality metadata for the searcher through an intuitively controllable user interface. The visualisation of stratagems is based on a strictly object-oriented tool-based model. This paper presents the graphical user interface with a particular view on the integration of stratagems to enable strategic support.

#! Reusability always has been a controversial topic in Digital Library (DL) design. While componentization has gained momentum in software engineering in general, there has not been broad DL standardization in component interfaces. Recently, the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) has begun to address this by creating a standard protocol for accessing metadata archives. We propose that the philosophy and approach adopted by the OAI can be extended easily to support inter-component protocols. In particular, we propose building DLs by connecting small components that communicate through a family of lightweight protocols, using XML as the data interchange mechanism. In order to test the feasibility of this, a set of protocols was designed based on the work of the OAI. Components adhering to these protocols were implemented and integrated into production and research DLs. The performance of these components was analyzed from the perspective of execution speed, network traffic, and data consistency. On the whole, this work has shown promise in the approach of applying the fundamental concepts of the OAI protocol to the task of DL component design and implementation.

#! In a digital environment, it is feasible to integrate multimedia materials into a library collection with ease. However, it seems likely that nontextual surrogates for multimedia objects, e.g., videos, could effectively augment textual representations of those objects. In this study, five video surrogates were evaluated in relation to their usefulness and usability in accomplishing specific tasks. The surrogates (storyboards with text or audio keywords, slide shows with text or audio keywords, fast forward) were created for each of seven video segments. Ten participants, all of whom watch videos at least monthly and search for videos at least occasionally, viewed the surrogates for seven video segments and provided comments about the strengths and weaknesses of each. In addition, they performed a series of tasks (gist determination, object recognition, action recognition, and visual gist determination) with three surrogates selected from those available. No surrogate was universally judged "best," but the fast forward surrogate garnered the most support, particularly from experienced video users. The participants expressed their understanding of video gist as composed of three components: topicality, the story of the video, and the visual gist of the video. They identified several real-world tasks for which they regularly use video collections. The viewing compaction rates used in these surrogates supported adequate performance, but users expressed a desire for more control over surrogate speed and sequencing. Further development of these surrogates is warranted by these results, as well as the development of mechanisms for surrogate display.

In particular, we consider the acquisition of the web archive. Issues are the definition of the perimeter of the French web and the choice of pages to read once or more times (to take changes into account). When several copies of the same page are kept, this leads to versioning issues that we briefly consider. Finally, we mention some first experiments.

#! We propose a methodology to evaluate the impact of a Digital Library's (DL) collection and the characteristics of its user community by an analysis of user retrieval patterns. Patterns of journal and document co-retrievals are reconstructed from DL server logs and used to generate proximity data for journals and documents, resulting in a weighted relation defined over the DL document collection represented by a network of document and journals. A measure of discrepancy between user-defined measures of document impact and the Journal Citation Record (JCR) Impact Factor (IF) published by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) is used to analyze characteristics of the DL user community. A preliminary analysis of the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Research Library (RL) server logs registered in 2001 demonstrates the potential of this approach.

Log analysis can be a primary source of knowledge about how digital library patrons actually use DL systems and services and how systems behave while trying to support user information seeking activities. Log recording and analysis allow evaluation assessment, and open opportunities to improvements and enhanced new services. In this paper, we propose an XML-based digital library log format standard that captures a rich, detailed set of system and user behaviors supported by current digital library services. The format is implemented in a generic log component tool, which can be plugged into any digital library system. The focus of the work is on interoperability, reusability, and completeness. Specifications, implementation details, and examples of use within the MARIAN digital library system are described.

#! OpenDLib is a software toolkit that can be used to create a digital library easily, according to the requirements of a given user community, by instantiating the software appropriately and then either loading or harvesting the content to be managed. OpenDLib consists of a federation of services that implement the digital library functionality making few assumptions about the nature of the documents to be stored and disseminated. If necessary, the system can be extended with other services to meet particular needs. The main focus of the paper is the openness and extendibility of the system. This feature has been obtained by applying a systematic approach to the design of the toolkit. A model of the system architecture has been defined in order to support this approach. The paper presents OpenDLib through this model.

#! Personalized classification refers to allowing users to define their own categories and automating the assignment of documents to these categories. In this paper, we examine the use of keywords to define personalized categories and propose the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) to perform personalized classification. Two scenarios have been investigated. The first assumes that the personalized categories are defined in a flat category space. The second assumes that each personalized category is defined within a pre-defined general category that provides a more specific context for the personalized category. The training documents for personalized categories are obtained from a training document pool using a search engine and a set of keywords. Our experiments have delivered better classification results using the second scenario. We also conclude that the number of keywords used can be very small and increasing them does not always lead to better classification performance.

#! As part of the Cervantes Project digital library, we are developing an Electronic Variorum Edition (EVE) of Don Quixote de la Mancha. Multiple editors can create an EVE with our Multi Variant Editor for Documents (MVED), which allows collation of one base text against several comparison texts to identify, link and edit all existing variants among them. In this context we are investigating the use of visualizations to depict graphically variants in order to validate the accuracy of the textual transcriptions and to understand the similarities and differences among different printings and editions. Our broader goal is to enable users to analyze the collation's results and to discover facts about the evolution of the Quixote textual history, and to provide evidence to eliminate printing and compositor's errors and thus to produce a more correct edition closer to Cervantes' original manuscript. This paper describes the visualization tool, and presents the initial results of its use.

#! Traditional digital library systems have certain limitations when dealing with complex or sensitive (e.g. proprietary) data. Collections of digital libraries have to be accessed individually and through non-uniform interfaces. By introducing a level of abstraction, a Meta-Digital Library or MetaDL, users gain a central access portal that allows for prioritized queries, evaluation and rating of the results, and secure negotiations to obtain primary data. This paper demonstrates the MetaDL architecture with an application in brain imaging research, BrassDL, the Brain Support Access System Digital Library. BrassDL is currently under development. This paper describes a theoretical framework behind it, addressing aspects from metadata extraction and system-supported negotiations to legal, ethical and sustainability issues.

#! With the popularity of the World Wide Web and the recognition of its worthiness of being archived we find numerous projects aiming at creating large-scale repositories containing excerpts and snapshots of Web data. Interfaces are being created that allow users to surf through time, analyzing the evolution of Web pages, or retrieving information using search interfaces. Yet, with the timeline and metadata available in such a Web archive, additional analyzes that go beyond mere information exploration, become possible. In this paper we present the AOLAP project building a Data Warehouse of such a Web archive, allowing its analysis and exploration from different points of view using OLAP technologies. Specifically, technological aspects such as operating systems and Web servers used, geographic location, and Web technology such as the use of file types, forms or scripting languages, may be used to infer e.g. technology maturation or impact.

#! The objectives of the EU-funded COVAX project are: 驴 to build a web service for search and retrieval of contemporary European cultural documents from memory institutions. 驴 to make existing library, archive and museum document descriptions accessible over the Internet. 驴 to assist memory institutions to provide access to their collections, regardless of document type or collection size. 驴 to implement standards and achieve interoperability between retrieval systems operating in the cultural heritage area.Partners in the project include technology developers and providers (public research organizations and private companies) and content owners (memory institutions). The content owners have collections of varying type and size, catalogued using a variety of library, museum and archiving systems. The project is assessing ways to improve access to these collections by converting samples of existing data into a limited set of common structured formats, each of which can be expressed using XML (eXtensible Markup Language).

#! Flexible digital library systems need to be able to accept, or "import," documents and metadata in a variety of forms, and associate metadata with the appropriate documents. This paper analyzes the requirements of the import process for general digital libraries. The requirements include (a) format conversion for source documents, (b) the ability to incorporate existing conversion utilities, (c) provision for metadata to be specified in the document files themselves and/or in separate metadata files, (d) format conversion for metadata files, (e) provision for metadata to be computed from the document content, and (f) flexible ways of associating metadata with documents or sets of documents. We argue that these requirements are so open-ended that they are best met by an extensible architecture that facilitates the addition of new document formats and metadata facilities to existing digital library systems. An implementation of this architecture is briefly described.

#* Migration on Request, a Practical Technique for Preservation
#@ Phil Mellor;Paul Wheatley;Derek M. Sergeant
#t 2002
#c 15
#! Maintaining a digital object in a usable state over time is a crucial aspect of digital preservation. Existing methods of preserving have many drawbacks. This paper describes advanced techniques of data migration which can be used to support preservation more accurately and cost effectively.To ensure that preserved works can be rendered on current computer systems over time, "traditional migration" has been used to convert data into current formats. As the new format becomes obsolete another conversion is performed, etcetera. Traditional migration has many inherent problems as errors during transformation propagate throughout future transformations.CAMiLEON's software longevity principles can be applied to a migration strategy, offering improvements over traditional migration. This new approach is named "Migration on Request." Migration on Request shifts the burden of preservation onto a single tool, which is maintained over time. Always returning to the original format enables potential errors to be significantly reduced.

#! This paper first proposes a high-level architecture for semiautomatically generating multimedia presentations by combining semantic inferencing with multimedia presentation generation tools. It then describes a system, based on this architecture, which was developed as a service to run over OAI archives - but is applicable to any repositories containing mixed-media resources described using Dublin Core. By applying an iterative sequence of searches across the Dublin Core meta-data, published by the OAI data providers, semantic relationships can be inferred between the mixed-media objects which are retrieved. Using predefined mapping rules, these semantic relationships are then mapped to spatial and temporal relationships between the objects. The spatial and temporal relationships are expressed within SMIL files which can be replayed as multimedia presentations. Our underlying hypothesis is that by using automated computer processing of metadata to organize and combine semantically-related objects within multimedia presentations, the system may be able to generate new knowledge by exposing previously unrecognized connections. In addition, the use of multilayered information-rich multimedia to present the results, enables faster and easier information browsing, analysis, interpretation and deduction by the end-user.

#! For effective real-life use, digital libraries must incorporate resource and system policies and adapt to user preferences and device characteristics. The caT (context-aware Trellis) hypertext model incorporates these policies and adaptation conditions within the Petri net specification of the digital library to support context-aware delivery of digital documents in a dynamically changing environment. This paper describes extensions to the caT architecture for supporting adaptation via smarter browsers and an external resource store to provide greater flexibility in information presentation. Browsers request resources that they can best display with their knowledge of intrinsic capabilities and constraints imposed on them by the devices that they run on. The data store returns the most appropriate version of a resource in response to browser requests, thus allowing maintainers of libraries to add, modify and remove resources without any changes to the structure, presentation or document pointers in the digital library.

This complex process involves both individual research and team design, and the use of a variety of online tools, such as an online cataloguing tool. Interactions amongst DWEL members are being ethnographically analysed in order to identify requirements for further development of these tools. The analysis suggests that many DWEL members envision their work as occurring in an integrated environment with stable documents, a situation which is not supported by the current configuration of DWEL tools. The design implications of these findings are reviewed.

This Product Library is a central part of DFD's multi-mission ground segment Data Information and Management System (DIMS) and is successfully in operation since 2000. Its data model is regularly extended to support products of upcoming earth observation missions. The Product Library implements a middleware filling the gap between application-level object data models and physical storage structures such as a digital robot archive with hierarchical storage management. This paper presents the principles of the Product Library middleware and its application in the specific earth observation context.

#! This paper reports on a formative evaluation of a prototype thesaurus-based retrieval system, which involved qualitative investigation of user search behaviour. The work is part of the ongoing 'FACET' project in collaboration with the National Museum of Science and Industry and its collections database. The main thesaurus employed in the project is the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus. The aim of the evaluation is to analyse at a micro level the user's interaction with interface elements in order to illuminate problems and inform interface design decisions. Data gathered included transcripts of think-aloud sessions, screen capture movie files, user action logs and observator notes. Key incidents from the sessions are analysed and the qualitative methodology is discussed. The evaluation analysis informs design issues concerning the allocation of search functionality to sub-windows, the appropriate role of thesaurus browsing in the search process, the formation of faceted queries and query reformulation. The analysis suggests that, although the prototype interface supports basic level operations, it does not provide nonexpert searchers with sufficient guidance on query structure and when to use the thesaurus. Conclusions are drawn that future work should further support and suggest models of the search process to the user.

#! A query language for Digital Libraries is presented, which offers access to documents by structure and sophisticated usage of meta-data. The language is based on a mathematical model of digital library documents, centered around a multilevel representation of documents as versions, views and manifestations. The core of the model is the notion of document view, which is recursive, and captures the content and structure of a document. The metadata representation distinguishes between formats and specifications, so being able to accommodate different meta-data formats, even for the same document. A query is a logical formula, and its result are the digital library documents satisfying the user query.

#! Music digital libraries pose interesting and challenging research problems, in particular for the development of methodologies and tools for the retrieval of music documents. One difficult aspect of content-based retrieval of musical works is that only scores can be represented by a symbolic notation, while performances, which are of interest for the majority of users, allow for access based on bibliographic values only. The research work reported in this paper proposes to index and retrieve music performances through an automatic alignment of acoustic recordings with the music scores. Alignment my allow for: automatic recognition of performances, aimed at cataloging large collections of recordings; automatic tagging of performances, aimed at an easy access to long recordings. The methodology is based on the use of hidden Markov models, a powerful tool that has been successfully used in many research areas, like speech recognition and molecular biology. The approach has been tested on a collection of acoustic and synthetic performances, showing good results in the recognition and in the tagging of performances. The proposed approach can be used to increase the functionalities of a music digital library, allowing for content-based access to scores and recordings.

This paper discusses strategies for directing autonomous search based on spatio-temporal distributions. We discuss a model for search assuming that the environment is static, except for the effect of identifying object locations. Algorithms are designed and compared for autonomously directing a robot.

#! Techniques for automatic query expansion from top retrieved documents have recently shown promise for improving retrieval effectiveness on large collections but there is still a lack of systematic evaluation and comparative studies. In this paper we focus on term-scoring methods based on the differences between the distribution of terms in (pseudo-)relevant documents and the distribution of terms in all documents, seen as a complement or an alternative to more conventional techniques. We show that when such distributional methods are used to select expansion terms within Rocchio's classical reweighting scheme, the overall performance is not likely to improve. However, we also show that when the same distributional methods are used to both select and weight expansion terms the retrieval effectiveness may considerably improve. We then argue, based on their variation in performance on individual queries, that the set of ranked terms suggested by individual distributional methods can be combined to further improve mean performance, by analogy with ensembling classifiers, and present experimental evidence supporting this view. Taken together, our experiments show that with automatic query expansion it is possible to achieve performance gains as high as 21.34% over non-expanded query (for non-interpolated average precision). We also discuss the effect that the main parameters involved in automatic query expansion, such as query difficulty, number of selected documents, and number of selected terms, have on retrieval effectiveness.

Indeed, the underlying question is about the truth of a description: obvious (ontological), by convention (normative) or based on interpretation (hermeneutical). In the first part, we examine the differences between these three points of view and choose the hermeneutical one. Then in the second and third part, we present two "assisted interpretation systems" (AIS) for digital libraries (audiovisual documents and scholarly publications). Both provide a dynamic annotation framework for readers' augmentations and social interactions. In the fourth part, a few synthetic guidelines are given to design such "assisted interpretation systems" in other digital libraries.

This paper presents the novel concept of system-mediated information access, i.e. system support for the user in clarifying and refining a vague information need and in generating a good formulation for it. The concept is based on two main assumptions: firstly, on document clustering's ability to reveal the topical, semantic structure of a domain of interest, represented by a specialized collection, and secondly, on the capacity of language models to convey content. Experimental results show that these assumptions are correct and that there is potential to significantly improve the retrieval performance by generating a better query through mediation.

The proposed method has the advantage of providing a robust bibliographic matching function using the statistical description of the syntax of bibliographic strings, a language model and an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) error model. The method also has the advantage of reducing the cost of preparing training data for parameter estimation, using records in the bibliographic database.

#! The development of techniques to support content-based access to archives of digital video information has recently started to receive much attention from the research community. During 2001, the annual TREC activity, which has been benchmarking the performance of information retrieval techniques on a range of media for 10 years, included a "track" or activity which allowed investigation into approaches to support searching through a video library. This paper is not intended to provide a comprehensive picture of the different approaches taken by the TREC2001 video track participants but instead we give an overview of the TREC video search task and a thumbnail sketch of the approaches taken by different groups. The reason for writing this paper is to highlight the message from the TREC video track that there are now a variety of approaches available for searching and browsing through digital video archives, that these approaches do work, are scalable to larger archives and can yield useful retrieval performance for users. This has important implications in making digital libraries of video information attainable.

#t 2007

#! In this paper, we study the problem of maintaining metadata for open Web content. In digital libraries such as DLESE, NSDL and G-Portal, metadata records are created for some good quality Web content objects so as to make them more accessible. These Web objects are dynamic making it necessary to update their metadata records. As Web metadata maintenance involves manual efforts, we propose to reduce the efforts by introducing the Key element-Context (KeC) model to monitor only those changes made on Web page content regions that concern metadata attributes while ignoring other changes. We also develop evaluation metrics to measure the number of alerts and the amount of efforts in updating Web metadata records. KeC model has been experimented on metadata records defined for Wikipedia articles, and its performance with different settings is reported. The model is implemented in G-Portal as a metadata maintenance module.

Simple clusters have been created for a collection of more than six and a half million library metadata records using a linear clustering algorithm. The created clusters are used to enrich the metadata records, and search results are presented to the user using a faceted browsing interface alongside a ranked result list. The most frequent tags in the different facets in the search result can be calculated and presented at a rate of approximately three million records per second per machine.

#! The countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) that were part of the Soviet Bloc or were non-aligned (Yugoslavia) entered the 1990s with telecommunications penetration of about fifteen telephones per hundred persons and a weak technical infrastructure based on pre-Cold War mechanical switching technology. They lacked digital transmission systems, fiber optics, microwave links, and automated systems control and maintenance. Until 1990, business, government, and education made little use of computers, although some mainframe-based data processing centers handled scientific and military applications. Communication technologies such as typewriters, photocopiers, and facsimile machines were registered and controlled to varying degrees in each country. The CEE countries could not legally make connections between their computer networks and those of countries outside the Soviet Bloc owing to the COCOM regulations and other embargoes imposed on the region by the West, although clandestine network connections were widely known to exist. In the fifteen-plus years since the collapse of the Soviet Bloc, these countries have made rapid advances in infrastructure and economics, and several already have become members of the European Union. Yet many challenges remain, especially with regard to infrastructure maturity, linguistics, and intellectual property.

#* PROBADO --- A Generic Repository Integration Framework
#@ Harald Krottmaier;Frank Kurth;Thorsten Steenweg;Hans-Jürgen Appelrath;Dieter Fellner
#t 2007
#c 15
#! The number of newly generated multimedia documents (e.g. music, e-learning material, or 3D-graphics) increases year by year. Today, the workflow in digital libraries focuses on textual documents only. Hence, considering content-based retrieval tasks, multimedia documents are not analyzed and indexed sufficiently. To facilitate content-based retrieval and browsing, it is necessary to introduce recent techniques for multimedia document processing into the workflow of nowadays digital libraries. In this short paper, we introduce the PROBADO-framework which will (a) integrate different types of content-repositories --- each one specialized for a specific multimedia domain --- into one seamless system, and (b) will add features available in text-based digital libraries (such as automatic annotation, full-text retrieval, or recommender services) to non-textual documents. Existing libraries will benefit from the framework since it extends existing technology for handling textual documents with features for dealing with the non-textual domain.

Uniform access to metadata is impeded by the structural and semantic heterogeneities of the metadata and metadata schemes used in the source systems. In this paper we discuss the methodologies we applied to ingest proprietary metadata into the BRICKS digital library network and to process CIDOC CRM metadata in terms of search and retrieval, and how we strove to hide the semantic complexity from the end-user while exploiting the semantic richness of the underlying metadata.

This requires active management and on-going appraisal over the entire life-cycle of scholarly and scientific materials.Whether there is a desire to make materials as open as possible or a requirement to keep them closed and private (for example in the case of sensitive personal data), legal elements can have a huge impact on the overall ability to effectively curate and preserve digital information over time.The DCC advocates the development of a framework for any curation activity that includes consideration of legal matters throughout. - from copyright and licensing models, to freedom of information and data protection.

JORUM is a national learning object repository for sharing and repurposing educational materials. The purpose of the Depot is to ensure that all UK academics can enjoy the benefits of Open Access for their peerreviewed post-prints by providing a repository for the interim period before every university has such repository provision. GRADE has been investigating and reporting on the technical and cultural issues around the reuse of geospatial data in the context of media-centric, informal and institutional repositories. With the DataShare project, by supporting academics who wish to share datasets on which written research outputs are based, a network of institution-based data repositories will develop a niche model for deposit of `orphaned datasets' currently filled neither by centralised subject-domain data archives nor institutional repositories.

#! Digital Libraries are currently discovering the full potential of web technologies in conjunction with building rich user communities and retaining customers. A visit to a digital library should nowadays offer more than passive consumption of content. Both the library and the user can benefit from moving forward from the "content provider" vs. "consumer" paradigm to the "prosumer" paradigm, thus allowing the user to produce and actively contribute content, interact with content and be part of communities of interest. We are presenting a smart annotation tool developed as part of the 'Living Memory' applications in the context of the EU-project BRICKS that supports the prosumer approach by inviting users to contribute new information by annotating content or commenting other annotations, thereby creating new knowledge in a collaborative way.

#! Placeholders in physical documents provide critical support for the human reader in relocating material and their place in the text. However, the equivalent tools in digital documents have long been identified as suffering from unintuitive interactions and low rates of use. This paper evaluates the current bookmarking technologies found in digital document readers, and identifies a number of specific and significant shortcomings in their support for user activity. We introduce some simple interactions that close the gap between user requirements and the placeholder support in a simple document reader program. Through this, we demonstrate that improved interactions can be created that reduce the barriers that inhibit placeholder use in digital documents.

The decision process on which actions to take to preserve a given set of digital objects for future access, i.e., preservation planning, is usually an ad-hoc procedure with little tool support and even less support for automation.This paper presents the integration of tools and services for object migration and characterization through a service oriented architecture into a planning tool called Plato, thus creating a distributed and highly automated preservation planning environment.

#! The (automatic) extraction of significant characteristics of files is an important feature of all long term preservation activities. We propose, however, that for the necessary automatic evaluation of the outcomes of certain preservation actions --- notably migration --- an approach is necessary, which follows other traditions in the abstraction of format descriptions. To implement a strategy for the automatic evaluation of various actions within a preservation environment, we define two formal, XML base languages: One allowing to define the content of a specific file, the other describing a file format in such a way, that it can be handled by multi-purpose software.

#! One of the uses of social tagging is to associate freely selected terms (tags) to resources for sharing resources among tag consumers. This enables tag consumers to locate new resources through the collective intelligence of other tag creators, and offers a new avenue for resource discovery. This paper investigates the effectiveness of tags as resource descriptors determined through the use of text categorisation using Support Vector Machines. Two text categorisation experiments were done for this research, and tags and web pages from del.icio.us were used. The first study concentrated on the use of terms as its features. The second study used both terms and its tags as part of its feature set. The results indicate that the tags were not always reliable indicators of the resource contents. At the same time, the results from the terms only experiment were better compared to the experiment with terms and tags. A deeper analysis of a sample of tags and documents were also conducted and implications of this research are discussed.

#! TagNSearch is a map-based tool for searching and browsing geo-tagged photographs based on their associated tags. Using Flickr as the dataset, TagNSearch returns, for a given query, photographs clustered by locations, and summarizes each cluster of photographs by cluster-specific tags. A map-based interface is also provided to help users better search, navigate and browse photographs and their clusters. A qualitative evaluation comparing TagNSearch and an existing tag search support in Flickr was also conducted. The task involved finding locations associated with a set of photographs. Participants were found to perform this task better using TagNSearch than Flickr.

By adding corresponding citation links to the original text, we can help contextualize the source material. In this paper we introduce an algorithm for identifying citations automatically based on an analysis of the structure of quotations from three different reference works of Latin texts. An evaluation shows that this approach is capable of finding a large number of quotations with which no machine actionable citations are associated. Additionally this approach can be applied for quotations that have been altered in a range of ways from their source.

#! A variety of software tools commonly used in research and industry allow a user to select (usually contiguous) segments of content to be annotated, referenced, or otherwise distinguished from a containing document. However, digital libraries (DLs) often curate only full documents, not these selected sub-documents. Thus, sub-documents in a DL may not have the full complement of metadata, and they may not be visible using DL browse and search facilities. We are interested in explicit representation of sub-documents in a DL environment. In this paper, we show how sub-documents may be represented and curated. We focus on the explicit representation of what we call a mark- an encapsulated address of a sub-document along with associated context. Our contributions are: a software architecture for representing marks as first-class objects together with regular documents in a DL; and an implementation of our architecture using existing software packages with modest enhancements. This approach provides new capabilities for the DL with minimal modification to tools and interfaces familiar to the DL user.

#! This paper presents Impact-ED, a new model for digital library impact evaluation. The model draws on assumptions from the Theory of Planned Behaviour and the Sense-Making Model. The paper discusses the current shortfalls of digital library impact evaluation and presents an alternative. Knowledge and attitude are put forward as potential measures of impact and different methods are triangulated and data linked to provide a comprehensive picture of the impact of the library at the time of use. The model shows how the digital library is being used to benefit users in their work, how it is changing their knowledge and attitudes and how the information found is used in real-time in the real world. It is being tested in the healthcare domain on the National Resource for Infection Control (www.nric.org.uk) but is expected to be transferable to other domains as further work will prove.

#! The reinterpretation of the traditional reference service in an online context is the virtual reference desk. Placing reference services into an online setting, however, presents many challenges. We report a study and analytic framework which addresses support for decision-making during virtual enquiry work. Focusing on specialist law-libraries, the study shows that enquirers do not volunteer important information to the service and that asynchronous communication media and some social obstacles present barriers to prompting. Also, previous enquiries are frequently used to inform current enquiry strategies but barriers exist in accessing this information. We conclude that email is an inadequate medium for supporting virtual reference services, and that system should support automatic, speculative matching between new enquiry content and integrated enquiry knowledge bases. The contribution of the framework is to offer a structured approach to evaluation in multiple virtual reference contexts and enable rapid convergence on barriers to efficient and effective service.

#! In this paper, we describe a qualitative user study of Searchling --- an experimental visual interface that allows users to leverage a bilingual thesaurus for query formulation and enhancement. The design of Searchling is based on theories of thesaurus-based interface design from Shiri et al. [1], combined with the principles of rich-prospect browsing [2]. The Searchling interface provides the user with three working spaces on one screen: the Thesaurus space, Query space, and Document space. We interviewed 15 graduate and faculty researchers at the University of Alberta, who carried out three structured tasks in a thinkaloud protocol, with simultaneous audio recording and screen capture. These participants identified a number of significant advantages to the researcher provided by Searchling, including the value of having an interface that could help with identifying search terms, suggesting preferred terms, and giving bilingual search support. They also suggested areas for future improvement, primarily related to our assumption that common knowledge of thesauri would be sufficient to make the various features clear if they were described using standard vocabulary from the thesaurus field.

This tool models its issue as a generic search problem that can easily be adapted to different application scenarios. In particular, to guarantee its extensibility we carefully identify, isolate and organise the VDL Generator constituents, i.e. (i) the set of logical componentsthat can be used when designing a Digital Library, (ii) the set of physical componentsthat by implementing the logical components contribute to implement the Digital Library and (iii) the search strategyexploited to accomplish the generation task. Furthermore, we report on the experiences matured in implementing and exploiting such an innovative service in the context of the DiligentEU funded project and discuss future plans for its consolidation.

The registry will be accessible for all the interested parties and will be the source over which the different impact models can be applied.

#! Bibliographic metadata plays a key role in scientific literature, not only to summarise and establish the facts of the publication record, but also to track citations between publications and hence to establish the impact of individual articles within the literature. Commercial secondary publishers have typically taken on the role of rekeying, mining and analysing this huge corpus of linked data, but as the primary literature has moved to the world of the digital repository, this task is now undertaken by new services such as Citeseer, Citebase or Google Scholar. As institutional and subject-based repositories proliferate and Open Access mandates increase, more of the literature will become openly available in well managed data islands containing a much greater amount of detailed bibliometric metadata in formats such as RDF. Through the use of efficient extraction and inference techniques, complex relations between data items can be established. In this paper we explain the importance of the co-relation in enabling new techniques to rate the impact of a paper or author within a large corpus of publications.

#! Today, bibliographic digital libraries play an important role in helping members of academic community search for novel research. In particular, author disambiguation for citations is a major problem during the data integration and cleaning process, since author names are usually very ambiguous. For solving this problem, we proposed two kinds of correlations between citations, namely, Topic Correlationand Web Correlation, to exploit relationships between citations, in order to identify whether two citations with the same author name refer to the same individual.The topic correlation measures the similarity between research topics of two citations; while the Web correlation measures the number of co-occurrence in web pages. We employ a pair-wise grouping algorithm to group citations into clusters. The results of experiments show that the disambiguation accuracy has great improvement when using topic correlation and Web correlation, and Web correlation provides stronger evidences about the authors of citations.

#! One of the main challenges in integrating two hierarchies (e.g., of books or web pages) is determining the correspondence between the edges of each hierarchy. Traditionally, this process, which we call hierarchy matching, is done by comparing the text associated with each edge. In this paper we instead use the placement of objects present in both hierarchies to infer how the hierarchies relate. We present two algorithms that, given a hierarchy with known facets(attribute-value pairs that define what objects are placed under an edge), determine feasible facets for a second hierarchy, based on shared objects. One algorithm is rule-based and the other is statistics-based. In the experimental section, we compare the results of the two algorithms, and see how their performances vary based on the amount of noise in the hierarchies.

The approach uses a special printer driver that allows information about hyperlinks to be extracted and stored at print time.

The digital library contains course materials and medical images collected in the patient's diagnosis process. The originality of the paper is given by the presentation of two access modalities to multimedia information from the digital library: content-based visual query and semantic query. The content-based visual query can be effectuated at the image or region level using colour and texture characteristics automatically extracted from medical images at their loading in the database. Also, semantic queries against the multimedia database can be automatically launched with the help of the topic map based on a part of MeSH thesaurus, the part that includes the medical diagnosis names. The student can navigate through topic map depending on its interest subject, bringing in this way big advantages. These access paths can be combined for retrieving the interest information. The multimedia digital library represents a very useful tool in the medical knowledge improvement, addressing to the students, resident doctors, young specialists or family doctors.

#! Meta-searching library communities involve access to sources where metadata are invisible behind query interfaces. Many of the query interfaces utilize predefined abstract Access Points for the implementation of the search services, without any further access to the underlining meta-data and query methods. The existence of unsupported Access Points and its consequences, which are either query failures or inconsistent query answers, creates a major issue when meta-searching this kind of systems. An example of the abstract Access Point based search model is the Z39.50 information retrieval protocol, which is widely used by the library community. In this paper we present the zSAPN (Z39.50 Semantic Access Point Network), a system which improves the search consistency and eliminates the query failures by exploiting the semantic information of the Access Points from an RDFS description. The current implementation of zSAPN is in the context of the Z39.50 protocol, using the official specification of the Access Point semantics and can benefit the huge number of the available sources worldwide. zSAPN substitutes each unsupported Access Point with a set of other supported ones, whose appropriate combination would either broaden or narrow the initial semantics, according to the user's choice. Finally, we estimate the impact of the modification of the initial semantics during the substitution process to the precision or the recall of the original query, with the unsupported Access Point.

#! We propose a search method that uses sentence-based inverted indexes to achieve high accuracy at practical speeds. The proposed method well supports the vast majority of queries entered on the web; these queries contain single words, multiple words for proximity searches, and semantically direct phrases. The existing approach, the inverted index which holds word-level position data is not efficient, because the size of index becomes extremely large. Our solution is to drop the word position data and index only the existence of each word in each sentence. We incorporate the sentence-based inverted index into a commercial search engine and evaluate it using both Japanese and English standard IR corpuses. The experiment shows that our method offers high accuracy, while index size and search processing time are greatly reduced.

We present iClusterDL, a self-organising overlay network that supports information retrieval and filtering functionality in a digital library environment. iClusterDLis able to handle huge amounts of data provided by digital libraries in a distributed and self-organising way. The two-tier architecture and the use of semantic overlay networks provide an infrastructure for creating large networks of digital libraries that require minimum administration, yet offer a rich set of tools to the end-user. We present the main components of our architecture, the protocols that regulate peer interactions, and an experimental evaluation that shows the efficiency, and the retrieval and filtering effectiveness of our approach.

#! In this paper, we present a framework for managing heterogeneous, multimodal digitized music collections containing visual music representations (scanned sheet music) as well as acoustic music material (audio recordings). As a first contribution, we propose a preprocessing workflow comprising feature extraction, audio indexing, and music synchronization (linking the visual with the acoustic data). Then, as a second contribution, we introduce novel user interfaces for multimodal music presentation, navigation, and content-based retrieval. In particular, our system offers high quality audio playback with time-synchronous display of the digitized sheet music. Furthermore, our system allows a user to select regions within the scanned pages of a musical score in order to search for musically similar sections within the audio documents. Our novel user interfaces and search functionalities will be integrated into the library service system of the Bavarian State Library as part of the Probado project.

#! One of many challenges facing web preservation efforts is the lack of metadata available for web resources. In prior work, we proposed a model that takes advantage of a site's own web server to prepare its resources for preservation. When responding to a request from an archiving repository, the server applies a series of metadata utilities, such as Jhove and Exif, to the requested resource. The output from each utility is included in the HTTP response along with the resource itself. This paper addresses the question of feasibility: Is it in fact practical to use the site's web server as a just-in-time metadata generator, or does the extra processing create an unacceptable deterioration in server responsiveness to quotidian events? Our tests indicate that (a) this approach can work effectively for both the crawler and the server; and that (b) utility selection is an important factor in overall performance.

#! Taking the temporal dimension into account in searching, i.e., using time of content creation as part of the search condition, is now gaining increasingly interest. However, in the case of web search and web warehousing, the timestamps (time of creation or creation of contents) of web pages and documents found on the web are in general not known or can not be trusted, and must be determined otherwise. In this paper, we describe approaches that enhance and increase the quality of existing techniques for determining timestamps based on a temporal language model. Through a number of experiments on temporal document collections we show how our new methods improve the accuracy of timestamping compared to the previous models.

#! A lexical signature (LS) is a small set of terms derived from a document that capture the "aboutness" of that document. A LS generated from a web page can be used to discover that page at a different URL as well as to find relevant pages in the Internet. From a set of randomly selected URLs we took all their copies from the Internet Archive between 1996 and 2007 and generated their LSs. We conducted an overlap analysis of terms in all LSs and found only small overlaps in the early years (1996 茂戮驴 2000) but increasing numbers in the more recent past (from 2003 on). We measured the performance of all LSs in dependence of the number of terms they consist of. We found that LSs created more recently perform better than early LSs created between 1996 and 2000. All LSs created from year 2000 on show a similar pattern in their performance curve. Our results show that 5-, 6- and 7-term LSs perform best with returning the URLs of interest in the top ten of the result set. In about 50% of all cases these URLs are returned as the number one result and in 30% of all times we considered the URLs as not discoved.

#! At the end of last century (Internet time elapses much quicker than normal time, and it already looks like a long time ago), the "information explosion" on the Web on one side, and the flourishing of research activities on digital library technologies on the other, spurred heated discussions about the future of traditional libraries. The view of one camp was that since "all" the information was available on-line, the use of smart search engines and clever software tools would allow Digital Libraries to provide all the information (and the services) needed by an information seeker. The view of the other camp was that the value of information was not just in its sheer quantity, but was rather in the organization and the quality of the information made available, and that could never be done by "programs".

#* An XML-Centric Storage for Better Preservation and Maintenance of Data: Union Catalog of NDAP, Taiwan

#t 2008
#c 15
#! The Union Catalog (UC) of Taiwan was established to provide an integrated search service for millions of digital objects distributed in the databases of different institutions. The main challenge is how to continuously and consistently manage large quantities of data. XML technologies have already been recommended for greater data preservation rather than database systems. In addition, we assume that a database design in our case would be complex and that consistent maintenance would be difficult. For this reason, databases are not used as the primary storage mechanism of the UC. Although the UC adopts an XML-centric architecture, it has difficulty handling data queries, data modification, and category listing efficiently. In this paper, we discuss how we use XML technologies to implement the UC system, and how we solve the issues arising from XML's limitations.

The creation of a concrete plan for preserving a collection of digital objects of a specific institution necessitates the evaluation of available solutions against clearly defined and measurable criteria. This process is called preservation planning and aids in the decision making process to find the most suitable preservation strategy considering the institution's requirements, the planning context and available actions applicable to the objects contained in the repository. Performed manually, this evaluation promises to be hard and tedious work, inasmuch as there exist numerous potential preservation action tools of different quality. In this demonstration, we present Plato [4], an interactive software tool aimed at creating preservation plans.

#! The unencoded Chinese character problem that occurs when digitizing historical Chinese documents makes digital archiving difficult. Expanding the character coding space, such as by using the Unicode Standard, does not solve the problem completely due to the extensibility of Chinese characters. In this paper, we propose a mechanism based on a Chinese glyph structure database, which contains glyph expressions that represent the composition of Chinese characters. Users can search for Chinese characters through our web interface and browse the search results. Each Chinese character can be embedded in a web document using a specific Java Script code. When the web document is opened, the Java Script code will load the image of the Chinese character in an appropriate font size for display. Even if the Chinese characters are not available in the database, their images can be generated through the dynamic character composition function. As the proposed mechanism is cross-platform, users can easily access unencoded Chinese characters without installing any additional font files in their personal computers. A demonstration system is available at http://char.ndap.org.tw.

#@ Jan Schnasse;Sebastian Beyl;Elona Chudobkaite;Volker Heydegger;Manfred Thaller
#t 2008
#c 15
#! Today file format specifications are formulated in natural languages. A programmer who wants to decode, encode or render the information contained in a file has to read through the specification before translating it into the terms of a programming language. The maintainer of the format usually eases that process by the deployment of libraries for the format. While this is a well proven process the translation from one format into another format is often an errorprone undertaking, nevertheless. For content holders format conversion is one strategy to assure long term access to their digital resources. However, currently there is still no standardised automatic procedure for the evaluation of format conversions available. Mainly in the case where format conversion is used as a strategy for long time preservation of digital content, this is a serious gap. With the Extensible Characterisation Languages (XCL) we want to address the problem of automatic evaluation of format conversions.

We are increasingly confronted with scientific findings, historical events and cultural achievements presented in electronic form. The rapid pace of technical change is causing data carriers and data formats to age quickly. The result is an acute threat to the long-term usability of digital objects which serve as sources for science and research. The necessity for long-term preservation has to be anchored in the social context of the national information, research and cultural policy, and the global integrations of science and research. To examine the preservation needs in the context of large scaled research facilities the awareness and practices at the University of Göttingen and at the ETH Zürich was explored. As a first step, an online questionnaire was developed and conducted in summer 2007. The poster explains first findings of the online survey.

#* Digital libraries as phenotypes for digital societies
#@ Gary Marchionini
#t 2009
#c 15
#! The research and development community has been actively creating and deploying digital libraries for more than two decades and many digital libraries have become indispensable tools in the daily life of people around the world. Today's digital libraries include interactive multimedia and powerful tools for searching and sharing content and experience. As such, digital libraries are moving beyond personal intellectual prostheses to become much more participative and reflective of social history. Digital libraries not only acquire, preserve, and make available informational objects, but also invite annotation, interaction, and leverage usage patterns to better serve patron needs. These various kinds of usage patterns serve two purposes: first, they serve as context for finding and understanding content, and second, they themselves become content that digital libraries must manage and preserve. Thus, digital library research has expanded beyond technical and informational challenges to consider new opportunities for recommendations, support of affinity groups, social awareness, and cross-cultural understanding, as well as new challenges related to personal and group identity, privacy and trust, and curating and preserving ephemeral interactions. This trend makes digital libraries cultural institutions that reveal and hopefully preserve the phenotypes of societies as they evolve. This talk will illustrate this theoretical perspective with examples from our experience with the Open Video Digital Library over the past decade and with recent extensions (VidArch Project) that harvest YouTube video as a strategy for preserving cultural context for digital collections.

#* Curated databases
#@ Peter Buneman
#t 2009
#c 15
#! Most of our research and scholarship now depends on curated databases. A curated database is any kind of structured repository such as a traditional database, an ontology or an XML file, that is created and updated with a great deal of human effort. For example, most reference works (dictionaries, encyclopaedias, gazetteers, etc.) that we used to find on the reference shelves of libraries are now curated databases; and because it is now so easy to publish databases on the web, there has been an explosion in the number of new curated databases used in scientific research. Curated databases are of particular importance to digital librarians because the central component of a digital library - its catalogue or metadata - is very likely to be a curated database. The value of curated databases lies in the organisation, the annotation and the quality of the data they contain. Like the paper reference works they have replaced, they usually represent the efforts of a dedicated group of people to produce a definitive description of enterprise or some subject area. Given their importance to our work it is surprising that so little attention has been given to the general problems of curated databases. How do we archive them? How do we cite them? And because much of the data in one curated database is often extracted from other curated databases, how do we understand the provenance of the data we find in the database and how do we assess its accuracy? Curated databases raise challenging problems not only in computer science but also in intellectual property and the economics of publishing. I shall attempt to describe these.

#! With the significant growth in the number of available electronic documents on the Internet, intranets, and digital libraries, the need for developing effective methods and systems to index and organize E-documents is felt more than ever. In this paper we introduce a new method for automatic text classification for categorizing E-documents by utilizing classification metadata of books, journals and other library holdings, that already exists in online catalogues of libraries. The method is based on identifying all references cited in a given document and, using the classification metadata of these references as catalogued in a physical library, devising an appropriate class for the document itself according to a standard library classification scheme with the help of a weighting mechanism. We have demonstrated the application of the proposed method and assessed its performance by developing a prototype classification system for classifying electronic syllabus documents archived in the Irish National Syllabus Repository according to the well-known Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) scheme.

In this research we developed an interface, wikiSearch, to support that process. This interface flattened the typical multi-page implementation into a single layer that provided multiple memory aids. The interface was tested by 96 people who used the system in a laboratory to resolve multiple tasks. Assessment was through use, usability testing and closed and open perception questions. In general participants found that the interface enabled them to stay on track with their task providing a bird's eye view of the events - queries entered, pages viewed, and pertinent pages identified.

#! Digital libraries are increasingly relying on distributed services to support increasingly complex tasks such as retrieval or preservation. While there is a growing body of services for migrating digital objects into safer formats to ensure their long-term accessability, the quality of these services is often unknown. Moreover, emulation as the major alternative preservation strategy is often neglected due to the complex setup procedures that are necessary for testing emulation. However, thorough evaluation of the complete set of potential strategies in a quantified and repeatable way is considered of vital importance for trustworthy decision making in digital preservation planning. This paper presents a preservation action monitoring infrastructure that combines provider-side service instrumentation and quality measurement of migration web services with remote access to emulation. Tools are monitored during execution, and both their runtime characteristics and the quality of their results are measured transparently. We present the architecture of the presented framework and discuss results from experiments on migration and emulation services.

#! We consider the problem of e-Infrastructures that wish to reconcile the generality of their services with the bespoke requirements of diverse user communities. We motivate the requirement of functional adaptivity in the context of gCube, a service-based system that integrates Grid and Digital Library technologies to deploy, operate, and monitor Virtual Research Environments defined over infrastructural resources. We argue that adaptivity requires mapping service interfaces onto multiple implementations, truly alternative interpretations of the same functionality. We then analyse two design solutions in which the alternative implementations are, respectively, full-fledged services and local components of a single service. We associate the latter with lower development costs and increased binding flexibility, and outline a strategy to deploy them dynamically as the payload of service plugins. The result is an infrastructure in which services exhibit multiple behaviours, know how to select the most appropriate behaviour, and can seamlessly learn new behaviours.

#! Document navigation has become increasingly common place as the use of electronic documents has grown. Speed-Dependent Automatic Zooming (SDAZ) is one popular method for providing rapid movement within a digital text. However, there is evidence that details of the document are overlooked as the pace of navigation rises. We produced a document reader software where sound is used to complement the visual cues that a user searches for visually. This software was then evaluated in a user study that provides strong supportive evidence that nonvisual cues can improve user performance in visual seeking tasks.

We report a pilot study that was conducted to test the validity of each visualisation and analyses the results of both the quantitative analysis and subjective user reviews.

#! Information Retrieval systems spend a great effort on determining the significant terms in a document. When, instead, a user is looking at a document he cannot benefit from such information. He has to read the text to understand which words are important. In this paper we take a look at the idea of enhancing the perception of web documents with visualisation techniques borrowed from the tag clouds of Web 2.0. Highlighting the important words in a document by using a larger font size allows to get a quick impression of the relevant concepts in a text. As this process does not depend on a user query it can also be used for explorative search. A user study showed, that already simple TF-IDF values used as notion of word importance helped the users to decide quicker, whether or not a document is relevant to a topic.

#! This paper proposes exploiting both explicit and mined metadata for enriching Web searching with exploration services. On-line results clustering is useful for providing users with overviews of the results and thus allowing them to restrict their focus to the desired parts. On the other hand, the various metadata that are available to a WSE (Web Search Engine), e.g. domain/language/date/filetype, are commonly exploited only through the advanced (form-based) search facilities that some WSEs offer (and users rarely use). We propose an approach that combines both kinds of metadata by adopting the interaction paradigm of dynamic taxonomies and faceted exploration. This combination results to an effective, flexible and efficient exploration experience.

#! Query patterns enable effective information tools and provide guidance to users interested in posing complex questions about objects. Semantically, query patterns represent important questions, while syntactically they impose the correct formulation of queries. In this paper we address the development of query patterns at successive representation layers so as to expose dominant information requirements on one hand, and structures that can support effective user interaction and efficient implementation of query processing on the other. An empirical study for the domain of cultural heritage reveals an initial set of recurrent questions, which are then reduced to a modestly sized set of query patterns. A set of Datalog rules is developed in order to formally define these patterns which are also expressed as SPARQL queries.

#! Most libraries and other cultural heritage institutions use controlled knowledge organisation systems, such as thesauri, to describe their collections. Unfortunately, as most of these institutions use different such systems, unified access to heterogeneous collections is difficult. Things are even worse in an international context when concepts have labels in different languages. In order to overcome the multilingual interoperability problem between European Libraries, extensive work has been done to manually map concepts from different knowledge organisation systems, which is a tedious and expensive process. Within the TELplus project, we developed and evaluated methods to automatically discover these mappings, using different ontology matching techniques. In experiments on major French, English and German subject heading lists Rameau, LCSH and SWD, we show that we can automatically produce mappings of surprisingly good quality, even when using relatively naive translation and matching methods.

In particular, the progressive multiple alignment method applied to different OCR outputs based on the same images is discussed in this paper.

#! In digital libraries semantic techniques are often deployed to reduce the expensive manual overhead for indexing documents, maintaining metadata, or caching for future search. However, using such techniques may cause a decrease in a collection's quality due to their statistical nature. Since data quality is a major concern in digital libraries, it is important to be able to measure the (loss of) quality of metadata automatically generated by semantic techniques. In this paper we present a user study based on a typical semantic technique used for automatic metadata creation, namely taxonomies of author keywords and tag clouds. We observed experts assessing typical relations between keywords and documents over a small corpus in the field of chemistry. Based on the evaluation of this experiment, we focused on communalities between the experts' perception and thus draw a first roadmap on how to evaluate semantic techniques by proposing some preliminary metrics.

#! Bibliographic digital libraries play a significant role in conducting research and, in the past few years, have started to move from closed to more open social platforms. However, in this, they have faced challenges (e.g., from Web spam) in maintaining the level of scholarly precision--the ratio of relevant citations retrieved by search. This paper describes a hybrid approach that uses online social collaboration and reputation based social moderation to reduce the cost and to speed up the construction of scholarly bibliographies that are comprehensive, have better quality citations and higher precision. We implemented selected social features for an established digital humanities project (the Cervantes Project) and compared the results with a number of closed and open current bibliographies. We found this can help in building scholarly bibliographies and significantly improve precision outcomes.

While only 40% of the participants used the tool, all assessed its usefulness or perceived usefulness. Most participants used it as a source of new terms and concepts to support their current tasks; a few noted the novelty and perceived its potential value in serving as a stimulant.

#! This paper details research into building a Collaborative Educational Resource Design model by investigating two contrasting Kenyan / UK design case-studies and an evaluation of end-users and designers' perceptions of digital libraries and their usage patterns. The two case-studies compared are; case study 1 based on formal learning in an African university digital library. Case study 2 is centered on informal learning in an ongoing rural community digital library system which has a collaborative design model that is being designed, developed and reviewed within the UK and Africa. A small scale in-depth evaluation was done with 21 participants in case-study 1 but related to and with implications for the second case-study. In-depth user issues of access, ownership, control and collaboration are detailed and reviewed in relation to design implications. Adams & Blandford's 'information journey' framework is used to evaluate high-level design effects on usage patterns. Digital library design support roles and cultural issues are discussed further.

#! This paper presents a hybrid scavenger grid as an underlying hardware architecture for search services within digital libraries. The hybrid scavenger grid consists of both dedicated servers and dynamic resources in the form of idle workstations to handle medium-to large-scale search engine workloads. The dedicated resources are expected to have reliable and predictable behaviour. The dynamic resources are used opportunistically without any guarantees of availability. Test results confirmed that indexing performance is directly related to the size of the hybrid grid and intranet networking does not play a major role. A system-efficiency and cost-effectiveness comparison of a grid and a multiprocessor machine showed that for workloads of modest to large sizes, the grid architecture delivers better throughput per unit cost than the multiprocessor, at a system efficiency that is comparable to that of the multiprocessor.

#! In this paper, we propose a concept for using combined multimodal queries in the context of digital music libraries. Whereas usual mechanisms for content-based music retrieval only consider a single query mode, such as query-by-humming, full-text lyrics-search or query-by-example using short audio snippets, our proposed concept allows to combine those different modalities into one integrated query. Our particular contributions consist of concepts for query formulation, combined content-based retrieval and presentation of a suitably ranked result list. The proposed concepts have been realized within the context of the PROBADO Music Repository and allow for music retrieval based on combining full-text lyrics search and score-based query-by-example search.

#! This paper presents a structure we call XML Wavelet Tree (XWT) to represent any XML document in a compressed and self-indexed form. Therefore, any query or procedure that could be performed over the original document can be performed more efficiently over the XWT representation because it is shorter and has some indexing properties. In fact, XWT permits to answer XPath queries more efficiently than using the uncompressed version of the documents. XWT is also competitive when comparing it with inverted indexes over the XML document (if both structures use the same space).

#! Fish species identification is critical to the study of fish ecology and management of fisheries. Traditionally, dichotomous keys are used for fish identification. The keys consist of questions about the observed specimen. Answers to these questions lead to more questions till the reader identifies the specimen. However, such keys are incapable of adapting or changing to meet different fish identification approaches, and often do not focus upon distinguishing characteristics favored by many field ecologists and more user-friendly field guides. This makes learning to identify fish difficult for Ichthyology students. Students usually supplement the use of the key with other methods such as making personal notes, drawings, annotated fish images, and more recently, fish information websites, such as Fishbase. Although these approaches provide useful additional content, it is dispersed across heterogeneous sources and can be tedious to access. Also, most of the existing electronic tools have limited support to manage user created content, especially that related to parts of images such as markings on drawings and images and associated notes. We present SuperIDR, a superimposed image description and retrieval tool, developed to address some of these issues. It allows users to associate parts of images with text annotations. Later, they can retrieve images, parts of images, annotations, and image descriptions through text- and content-based image retrieval. We evaluated SuperIDR in an undergraduate Ichthyology class as an aid to fish species identification and found that the use of SuperIDR yielded a higher likelihood of success in species identification than using traditional methods, including the dichotomous key, fish web sites, notes, etc.

#! Custodians of digital content take action when the material that they are responsible for is threatened by, for example, obsolescence or deterioration. At first glance, ideal preservation actions retain every aspect of the original objects with the highest level of fidelity. Achieving this goal can, however, be costly, infeasible, and sometimes even undesirable. As a result, custodians must focus their attention on preserving the most significant characteristics of the content, even at the cost of sacrificing less important ones. The concept of significant characteristics has become prominent within the digital preservation community to capture this key goal. As is often the case in an emerging field, however, the term has become over-loaded and remains ill-defined. In this paper, we unpack the meaning that lies behind the phrase, analyze the domain, and introduce clear terminology.

#* User engagement in research data curation
#@ Luis Martinez-Uribe;Stuart Macdonald
#t 2009
#c 15
#! In recent years information systems such as digital repositories, built to support research practice, have struggled to encourage participation partly due to inadequate analysis of the requirements of the user communities. This paper argues that engagement of users in research data curation through an understanding of their processes, constraints and culture is a key component in the development of the data repositories that will ultimately serve them. In order to maximize the effectiveness of such technologies curation activities need to start early in the research lifecycle and therefore strong links with researchers are necessary. Moreover, this paper promotes the adoption of a pragmatic approach with the result that the use of open data as a mechanism to engage researchers may not be appropriate for all disciplinary research environments.

#! Due to the increasing complexity and world-wide distribution of digital objects, identification and enforcement of digital rights have become too complex to be carried out manually. It is necessary to take into account the case-specific applicable laws, the complete creation history of a work and the existing licenses. However, no formal generic model has been presented so far integrating these aspects. This paper presents an innovative domain ontology of the Intellectual Property Rights. It distinguishes four levels of abstraction or control: (1) the legal framework, (2) the individual rights people hold, (3) the individual usage agreements right holders and others may issue, and (4) the particular actions that are restricted by IPR regulations or bring particular rights into existence. The ontology has the potential to enable wide semantic interoperability of digital repositories for identifying existing rights on digital objects and tracing the impact of particular actions on rights and regulations.

#! All search happens in a particular context--such as the particular collection of a digital library, its associated search tasks, and its associated users. Information retrieval researchers usually agree on the importance of context, but they rarely address the issue. In particular, evaluation in the Cranfield tradition requires abstracting away from individual differences between users. This paper investigates if we can bring some of this context into the Cranfield paradigm. Our approach is the following: we will attempt to record the "context" of the humans already in the loop--the topic authors/assessors--by designing targeted questionnaires. The questionnaire data becomes part of the evaluation test-suite as valuable data on the context of the search requests.We have experimented with this questionnaire approach during the evaluation campaign of the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX). The results of this case study demonstrate the viability of the questionnaire approach as a means to capture context in evaluation. This can help explain and control some of the user or topic variation in the test collection. Moreover, it allows to break down the set of topics in various meaningful categories, e.g. those that suit a particular task scenario, and zoom in on the relative performance for such a group of topics.

This paper evaluates to which extent Google retrieved correct answers as responses to queries inferred from factual and topical requests in a digital Ask-a-Librarian service. 100 factual and 100 topical questions were picked from a digital reference service run by public libraries. The queries inferred simulated average Web queries. The top 10 retrieval results were observed for the answer. The inspection was stopped when the first correct answer was identified. Google retrieved correct answers to 42 % of the topical questions and 29 % of factual questions. Results concerning the characteristics of queries and retrieval effectiveness are also presented. Evaluations indicate that public libraries' reference services answer correctly 55 % of the questions. Thus, Google is not outperforming Ask-a-Librarian service, although it seems to perform relatively satisfactory in retrieving answers to topical questions.

So far, however, usability evaluation of such interfaces has been limited. In this paper, we present the usability evaluation of a repository interface, i.e., the interface of B@bele, the DSpace installation of the Multimedia Production Centre (CPM) of the University Milano-Bicocca. The results of this evaluation point out the most important shortcomings of the present DSpace interface: difficulties with browsing within communities and collections; problems with the submission interface due to scarcely familiar terminology (metadata) or terms that are not relevant in the specific academic context (community); problems in the submission process due to some ambiguous buttons, to the lack of authority files, and to the lack of clearly marked compulsory fields. In this way, this study will help improve not only B@bele, but also all other installations of DSpace currently available.

Conceptual graphs or knowledge maps of achievement standards reveal the macrostructure of the learning domain modeled by those standards and support higher-level understanding by teachers and students. The work builds on the conceptual framework of the AAAS knowledge maps by providing the means to flexibly define and deploy new relationship schemas to fit the disparate modeling needs of the nearly 740 learning standards documents in the ASN repository. Using an RDF-based, node-link representation of learning goals and the relationships among them, the ASN Knowledge Map Service will provide the framework to correlate educational resources to nodes in conceptual models in order to augment more conventional mechanisms of discovery and retrieval in digital libraries.

Thematic digital libraries can be valuable for organizing specific collections and for supporting emergent communities. This work focuses on two case studies, one in the area of the Fine Arts and the other in the area of Food and Nutrition. For building both digital libraries we propose to use the existing university repository infrastructure and to establish a metadata workflow that makes use of available descriptions in the library catalogues and in the university information system. We expect that such an approach, which takes into account the institutional context and resources, can be used in other collections at our university and inspire similar initiatives elsewhere.

This demonstration of the Recollection project of the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program at the Library of Congress will showcase a prototype platform, tools and environment for sharing and access to diverse born-digital collections. As the Program has addressed the development of distributed preservation through a national community of partner institutions, the challenge of access and interoperability has become more urgent. The network needs to be able to strategically bring collections under stewardship and keep an inventory without excessive burden on the collecting organizations. The data under stewardship is very diverse and follows standards acceptable within each content domain. These circumstances require an infrastructure that enables the community of NDIIPP Partners to share their collections and data on an ongoing basis. This allows NDIIPP to maintain the benefits of a distributed network of partners and also take advantage of the collections speaking to one another.

#! Taiwan's digital archives cover a broad range of cultural and natural assets. More than 2 million objects have been accumulated since the project was launched in 2002. As the number and diversity of digitised objects have increased rapidly, it has become increasingly difficult for people to gain a clear picture of the contents of the archives. To disseminate the abundant and diverse resources to the public, we are building a knowledge structure that consists of categorized keywords extracted from objects' metadata, and developing a function called "Tagging Tool" to facilitate fast and efficient mining of resources. For example, users who want to read an article enriched with archive collections can utilize the tool to identify archive specific keywords in the text automatically and annotate them with references to relevant resources. As a result, users can save a great deal of time on keyword searching, and contextualize various entities, such as historical events and people's names.

#! Traditionally, digitisation of cultural and scientific heritage material for use by the scholarly community has been led by supply rather than demand. The DiSCmap project commissioned by JISC in 2008, aimed to study what refocussing of digitisation efforts will suit best the users of digitised materials, especially in the context of the research and teaching in the higher education institutions in the UK. The paper presents some of its initial outcomes based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of 945 special collections nominated for digitisation by intermediary users (librarians, archivist and museum curators), as well as end users' study involving a combination of online survey, focus groups and in-depth interviews. The criteria for prioritising digitisation advanced by intermediaries and end users were analysed and cross-mapped to a range of existing digitisation frameworks. A user-driven prioritisation framework which synthesises the findings of the project is presented.

#! As digital libraries become more prevalent and as the amount of accessible online information grows, users often must consult diverse information collections in carrying out tasks. Simultaneously, the impact of frequent interruptions on task performance gets more severe. To manage the negative effects of interruptions on work performance, workers often engage in task management activities to ensure they are better prepared to resume suspended tasks. However, managing tasks causes additional cognitive burden and incurs a time cost to users who already are experiencing demands on their attention and time. We describe a system that allows users to browse their previous workspace intuitively, and enhances continuity of their tasks by supporting them to retrieve desired work context more quickly and easily.

In this work, we deal with these limitations by proposing a synthetic generator of ambiguous authorship records called SyGAR. The generator was validated against a gold standard collection of disambiguated records, and applied to evaluate three disambiguation methods in a relevant scenario.

We will show how various types of information may benefit from explicit geographic search, and where text-based place name search may be sufficient. We will also show how implicit geographic search (or geographic browsing) can be used to dynamically generate geographic searches in geographic interfaces like Google Earth. In this demostration we will show the algorithms used for Geographic search and how these may be combined with text search. In addition we will show results from the GeoCLEF IR evaluation for text-based search.

#* Active preservation
#@ Robert Sharpe;Adrian Brown

#! In order to perform long-term digital preservation it is necessary to be (i) understand the technology of the material being stored, (ii) be able to decide whether this technology is obsolete (and, if so, what to do about it) and (iii) perform verifiable actions to remove the causes of this obsolescence (e.g., via format migration). This demonstration will show a real-life solution for dealing with these challenges. It is based off pioneering work performed mainly in conjunction with the UK National Archives' Seamless Flow programme and the Planets project and is now deployed in a variety of national libraries and archives around the world.

#! ResCarta Tools are a suite of open source software applications which can assist in the creation of standardized digital objects. ResCarta Tools are open and modular in their design. Modules for creating digital objects store the metadata in Library of Congress METS/ MODS/MIX XML formats. Collection and indexing modules create LUCENE indexes for high speed fielded and full text retrieval of objects. The tools have been used to create digital collections from a variety of analog and digital sources. Collections can be hosted on the web using Apache TOMCAT and the ResCarta WEB application, which provides inline metadata using COINS. Integrating the use of DLESE OAI is done using the Collection Manager METS XML data. The tools have been used by small public libraries to host a dozen pamphlets and aerospace manufactures to host tens of thousands of documents and millions of pages.

#! Most digital library resources and the Web more generally are dynamic and ever-changing collections of information. However, most of the tools that have been developed for interacting with Web and DL content, such as browsers and search engines, focus on a single static snapshot of the information. In this talk, I will present analyses of how web content changes over time, how people re-visit web pages over time, and how re-visitation patterns are influenced by user intent and changes in content. These results have implications for many aspects of search including crawling, ranking algorithms, result presentation and evaluation. I will describe a prototype that supports people in understanding how information they interact with changes over time, by highlighting what content has changed since their last visit. Finally, I will describe a new retrieval model that represents features about the temporal evolution of content to inform crawl policy and improve ranking.

#! caT, a Petri net-based hypertext system, serves as a platform for unified modeling of digital library infrastructure and its governing policies, user characteristics, and their contextual information. Traditionally, users have created caT networks from scratch, thus limiting their use to small collections. In this paper we introduce TcAT, a component-based authoring tool, which enables the creation of large caT nets that can represent interaction-rich, real-life spaces such as libraries and museums. TcAT implements composition operations from Petri net theory, allowing authors to select and modify existing net fragments as templated building blocks for larger networks. Authors may switch between visual and textual modes at will, thus combining the strengths of expressing large nets textually and selecting net fragments via point-and-click interaction. A user evaluation of the new authoring mechanisms suggests that this is a promising tool for improving the efficiency of experienced users as well as that of novice users, who are unfamiliar with the Petri net formalism.

#! Today, digital libraries more and more have to rely on semantic techniques during the workflows of metadata generation, search and navigational access. But, due to the statistical and/or collaborative nature of such techniques, the underlying quality of automatically generated metadata is questionable. Since data quality is essential in digital libraries, we present a user study on one hand evaluating metrics for quality assessment, on the other hand evaluating their benefit for the individual user during interaction. To observe the interaction of domain experts in the sample field of chemistry, we transferred the abstract metrics' outcome for a sample semantic technique into three different kinds of visualizations and asked the experts to evaluate these visualizations first without, later augmented with the quality information. We show that the generated quality information is indeed not only essential for data quality assurance in the curation step of digital libraries, but will also be helpful for designing intuitive interaction interfaces for end-users.

Additionally, the limits of a "collection" are becoming blurred as connections are being built via hyperlinks to related resources outside of the library collection, such as Wikipedia and locally relevant websites. Ideas are suggested for future projects, including interface design and institutional use of user-contributed information.

#! Content-based image retrieval is becoming a popular way for searching digital libraries as the amount of available multimedia data increases. However, the cost of developing from scratch a robust and reliable system with content-based image retrieval facilities for large databases is quite prohibitive. In this paper, we propose to exploit an approach to perform approximate similarity search in metric spaces developed by [3, 6]. The idea at the basis of these techniques is that when two objects are very close one to each other they 'see' the world around them in the same way. Accordingly, we can use a measure of dissimilarity between the views of the world at different objects, in place of the distance function of the underlying metric space. To employ this idea the low level image features (such as colors and textures) are converted into a textual form and are indexed into the inverted index by means of the Lucene search engine library. The conversion of the features in textual form allows us to employ the Lucene's off-the-shelf indexing and searching abilities with a little implementation effort. In this way, we are able to set up a robust information retrieval system that combines full-text search with content-based image retrieval capabilities.

User-supplied evaluation constructs were shown to span both the performance and satisfaction dimensions of the video summary evaluation space. Most constructs achieved moderate to good inter-rater agreement in a consequent survey.

#! Music services, media players and managers provide support for content classification and access based on filtering metadata values, statistics of access, and user ratings. This approach fails to capture characteristics of mood and personal history that are often the deciding factor when creating personal playlists and collections in music. This paper presents MusicWiz, a music management environment that combines traditional metadata with spatial hypertext-based expression and automatically extracted characteristics of music to generate personalized associations between songs. MusicWiz's similarity inference engine combines the personal expression in the workspace with assessments of similarity based on the artists, other metadata, lyrics, and the audio signal to make suggestions and to generate playlists. An evaluation of MusicWiz with and without the workspace and suggestion capabilities showed significant differences for organizing and playlist creation tasks. The workspace features were more valuable for organizing tasks while the suggestion features had more value for playlist creation activities.

The required expertise and limited tool support discourage especially small institutions from operating archives with digital preservation capabilities. Hoppla is an archiving solution that combines back-up and fully automated migration services for data collections in environments with limited expertise and resources for digital preservation. The system allows user-friendly handling of services and outsources digital preservation expertise. This paper presents the automated logical preservation process of the Hoppla archiving system in detail. It describes the recommendation process for appropriate preservation strategies via a web update service. A set of two real world case studies were conducted based on a first rules set focused on common office documents. The promising results sustain the novel approach of automating logical preservation by outsourcing expertise.

#! The estimate of digitization costs is a very difficult task. It is difficult to make exact predictions due to the great quantity of unknown factors. However, digitization projects need to have a precise idea of the economic costs and the times involved in the development of their contents. The common practice when we start digitizing a new collection is to set a schedule, and a firm commitment to fulfill it (both in terms of cost and deadlines), even before the actual digitization work starts. As it happens with software development projects, incorrect estimates produce delays and cause costs overdrafts. Based on methods used in Software Engineering for software development cost prediction like COCOMO and Function Points, and using historical data gathered during five years at the Miguel de Cervantes Digital Library, during the digitization of more than 12.000 books, we have developed a method for time and cost estimates named DiCoMo (Digitization Costs Model) for digital content production in general. This method can be adapted to different production processes, like the production of digital XML or HTML texts using scanning and OCR, and undergoing human proofreading and error correction, or for the production of digital facsimiles (scanning without OCR). The accuracy of the estimates improve with time, since the algorithms can be optimized by making adjustments based on historical data gathered from previous tasks.

#! Many popular web sites use folksonomies to let people label objects like images (Flickr), music (Last.fm), or URLs (Delicous) with schema-free tags. Folksonomies may reveal personal information. For example, tags can contain sensitive information, the set of tagged objects might disclose interests, etc. While many users call for sophisticated privacy mechanisms, current folksonomy systems provide coarse mechanisms at most, and the system provider has access to all information. This paper proposes a privacy-aware folksonomy system. Our approach consists of a partitioning scheme that distributes the folksonomy data among four providers and makes use of encryption. A key sharing mechanism allows a user to control which party is able to access which data item she has generated. We prove that our approach generates folksonomy databases that are indistinguishable from databases consisting of random tuples.

#! There is growing recognition that exploratory search is less well supported by existing search interfaces than known-item search. In this paper, we report on a study in which three interfaces providing different levels of search support were developed and tested, for both known item and exploratory search tasks. A rich qualitative analysis of participants' search behaviours and perceptions was conducted. As expected, the simplest interface provided better support for known item than for exploratory search tasks. Conversely, richer search interface features were found to provide better support for exploratory search, but would distract people from the objective of more clearly defined search tasks. This study provides preliminary evidence that searching is most effective when supported by an interface that is tailored towards the search activities of the task.

#! In this article we propose the concept of relevance criteria profiles, which provide a global view of user behaviour in judging the relevance of retrieved information. We further propose a plotting technique which provides a session based overview of the relevance judgement processes interlaced with interactions that allow the researcher to visualise and quickly detect emerging patterns in both interactions and relevance criteria usage. We discuss by example, using data from a user study conducted between the months of January and August of 2008, how these tools support the better understanding of task based user valuation of documents that is likely to lead to recommendations for improving enduser services in digital libraries.

#! Evaluations of search features used in digital library environments are generally results centric, focussing on the outcome of an evaluation - for example, the number of relevant documents retrieved - rather than garnering an understanding of why that result was achieved. This paper explores how search feature development benefits from user-centered evaluation. By examining the application of an established web analytics technique, session analysis, to the development of search features and interfaces, it will be shown that designers can better understand how users conduct evaluation tasks. The feedback provided by this technique allows for clearer evaluation of an interface and admits iteratively evolving designs that are based on empirical data.

#! Many scientists and research groups make use of the DBLP bibliographic project collection in various ways. Most of them are unaware of its internal structure, although it can have significant influence on their results. Prior work has shown that the collection does not cover all sub-fields of computer science in the same quality but has not provided an explanation for these differences. We introduce an extension of the DBLP data set which gives us a detailed picture on how DBLP has evolved since 1995. We show that the project started with a narrow focus on two sub-fields and discuss how additional themes have been added in recent years.We analyze the relations between sub-fields at different times and provide a model which explains the differences in coverage.

#! Invenio is the web-based integrated digital library system developed at CERN. Within this framework, we present four types of ranking models based on the citation graph that complement the simple approach based on citation counts: time-dependent citation counts, a relevancy ranking which extends the PageRank model, a time-dependent ranking which combines the freshness of citations with PageRank and a ranking that takes into consideration the external citations. We present our analysis and results obtained on two main data sets: Inspire and CERN Document Server. Our main contributions are: (i) a study of the currently available ranking methods based on the citation graph; (ii) the development of new ranking methods that correct some of the identified limitations of the current methods such as treating all citations of equal importance, not taking time into account or considering the citation graph complete; (iii) a detailed study of the key parameters for these ranking methods.

#! Anyone offering content in a digital library is naturally interested in assessing its performance: how well does my system meet the users' information needs? Standard evaluation benchmarks have been developed in information retrieval that can be used to test retrieval effectiveness. However, these generic benchmarks focus on a single document genre, language, media-type, and searcher stereotype that is radically different from the unique content and user community of a particular digital library. This paper proposes to derive a domain-specific test collection from readily available interaction data in search logs files that captures the domain-specificity of digital libraries. We use as case study an archival institution's complete search log that spans over multiple years, and derive a large-scale test collection. We manually derive a set of topics judged by human experts--based on a set of e-mail reference questions and responses from archivists--and use this for validation. Our main finding is that we can derive a reliable and domain-specific test collection from search log files.

#! Recent work on analyzing query logs shows that a significant fraction of queries are temporal, i.e., relevancy is dependent on time, and temporal queries play an important role in many domains, e.g., digital libraries and document archives. Temporal queries can be divided into two types: 1) those with temporal criteria explicitly provided by users, and 2) those with no temporal criteria provided. In this paper, we deal with the latter type of queries, i.e., queries that comprise only keywords, and their relevant documents are associated to particular time periods not given by the queries. We propose a number of methods to determine the time of queries using temporal language models. After that, we show how to increase the retrieval effectiveness by using the determined time of queries to re-rank the search results. Through extensive experiments we show that our proposed approaches improve retrieval effectiveness.

In this paper we propose a novel approach to Entity Retrieval by using Web search engine query logs. We use Markov random walks on (1) Click Graphs - built from clickthrough data - and on (2) Session Graphs - built from user session information. We thus provide semantic bridges between different query terms, and therefore indicate meaningful connections between Entity Retrieval queries and related entities.

#! Digital libraries have the potential to be rich interactive environments or "shariums" that support students who work in groups to complete course work. To understand how DLs might realize this potential, the processes of a single group working on a complex project over a semester were analyzed. Findings suggest that groups perform a range of tasks including administrative, communication and information seeking and retrieval, and use multiple tools and artifacts to accomplish their work. Over the course of the work, activities shift from the individual to group illustrating the need for a complex system that intertwines public and private work space. Currently DLs provide only one tool - search - that a group might use, but do not fully support groupwork.

#! Scholarly research involves a systematic study of information sources in order to establish facts and reach new conclusions. It encompasses survey, analysis, evaluation, and creation as distinct phases that are performed iteratively and often in parallel by accessing a range of local and remote resources. Throughout these activities scholars create collections of relevant work, ranging from publication references to new information acquired through experiments or correspondence with other scholars. We use the term reading list to refer to such collections. Existing software packages or web services for managing publication lists, like CiteULike, lack integration with researchers' workflow which may require access to both desktop and online resources. In this paper we describe the architecture and system design of ScholarLynk, a desktop tagging tool that enables researchers to build and maintain reading lists across distributed data stores, in collaboration with other researchers.

#! Cultural heritage digital libraries hold promise both as a new tool for representing the complex information structures frequently found in the humanities and social sciences and as interactive environments that enable scholars to work with this information in new ways throughout the research project. Much attention has been paid to digitization, textual encoding, metadata and dissemination of digital cultural heritage data. Scholars now routinely turn toward electronic sources as a first step in their information finding process. Considerably less attention, however, has been devoted to understanding how to support the formative stages of scholarly research. In this paper, we highlight our finding from a formative user study of scholarly analysis of source documents in several different fields. We discuss the implications of these results for our current research into designing a web-based creativity support environment for cultural heritage digital libraries.

#! Collaboratively created online encyclopedias have become increasingly popular. Especially in terms of completeness they have begun to surpass their printed counterparts. Two German publishers of traditional encyclopedias have reacted to this challenge and decided to merge their corpora to create a single more complete encyclopedia. The crucial step in this merge process is the alignment of articles. We have developed a system to identify corresponding entries from different encyclopedic corpora. The base of our system is the alignment algorithm which incorporates various techniques developed in the field of information retrieval. We have evaluated the system on four real-world encyclopedias with a ground truth provided by domain experts. A combination of weighting and ranking techniques has been found to deliver a satisfying performance.

#! Understanding metadata written in natural language is a premise to successful automated integration of large scale, language-rich, classifications such as the ones used in digital libraries. We analyze the natural language labels within classification by exploring their syntactic structure, we then show how this structure can be used to detect patterns of language that can be processed by a lightweight parser with an average accuracy of 96.82%. This allows for a deeper understanding of natural language metadata semantics, which we show can improve by almost 18% the accuracy of the automatic translation of classifications into lightweight ontologies required by semantic matching, search and classification algorithms.

#! Common search engines process users' queries (i.e., information needs) by retrieving documents from pre-built term-based indexes. For digital libraries, such approaches are limited regarding particular contexts, such as specialized collections (e.g., cultural heritage collections) or specific retrieval criteria (e.g., multidimensional criteria). In this paper, we consider Information Retrieval systems exploiting geographic dimensions: spatial, temporal, and topical dimensions. Our contribution is twofold as we propose a Geographic Information Retrieval system evaluation framework and test the following hypothesis: combining spatial and temporal dimensions along with the topical dimension improves the effectiveness of Information Retrieval systems.

#! Digital Library support for textual and certain types of nontextual documents has significantly advanced over the last years. While Digital Library support implies many aspects along the whole library workflow model, interactive and visual retrieval allowing effective query formulation and result presentation are important functions. Recently, new kinds of non-textual documents which merit Digital Library support, but yet cannot be accommodated by existing Digital Library technology, have come into focus. Scientific primary data, as produced for example, by scientific experimentation, earth observation, or simulation, is such a data type. We report on a concept and first implementation of Digital Library functionality, supporting visual retrieval and exploration in a specific important class of scientific primary data, namely, time-oriented data. The approach is developed in an interdisciplinary effort by experts from the library, natural sciences, and visual analytics communities. In addition to presenting the concept and discussing relevant challenges, we present results from a first implementation of our approach as applied on a real-world scientific primary data set.

Therefore, we propose using the trace of users activity to limit this growth and document the vocabularies. A user will, for example, be able to follow and annotate the track of a vocabulary concept: from its creation to the last time it was used. From a broader point of view, this work is grounded on our Web based philological platform, DINAH, and is mainly motivated by our collaboration with a group of philosophers studying the handwritten manuscripts of Jean-Toussaint Desanti.

The use case of this problem is a plagiarism detection system that searches the Web for potentially plagiarized passages in a given suspicious document. For the query formulation problem we develop a heuristic search strategy based on co-occurrence probabilities. Compared to the maximal termset strategy [3], which can be considered as the most sensible non-heuristic baseline, our expected savings are on average 50% when queries for 9 or 10 phrases are to be constructed.

In a first experiment we show that this heuristic delivers better results (77.9% accuracy) than a support vector machine by CiteSeer (69.4% accuracy) in an 'academic search engine' scenario and better run times (8:19 minutes vs. 57:26 minutes).

We often use UML diagrams for our software development projects, and also for modeling XML DTDs and Schemas (1), finding that although UML diagrams can effectively be made to represent DTDs and Schemas (either using Class or Component diagrams), in real practice, complex DTDs and Schemas produce unreadable, unmanageable, complex UML diagrams. Recently we started exploring other types of diagrams and unconventional methods which can be both useful for designing and modeling semistructured data, and as teaching aids or thinking tools. This experience also served to open our minds to tools and methods other than the recognized mainstream practices. In this paper, we describe how we managed to use Mind Maps and a modified Freemind tool to successfully model, design, modify, import and export XML DTDs, XML Schemas (XSD and RNG) and also XML document instances, getting very manageable, easily comprehensible, folding diagrams. In this way, we converted a general purpose mind-mapping tool, into a very powerful tool for XML vocabulary design and simplification (and also for teaching XML markup, or for presentation purposes).

#! Recent research has identified inconsistency of public library digital services, and associated problems of disparity and duplication, as a key usability issue. The hypothesis of this research is that root cause is inconsistent definition and specification of digital services, and that a service taxonomy would facilitate resolution of this issue, providing a classification scheme and controlled vocabulary. Reporting on initial research to validate this hypothesis, which examined options available from 8 of 32 Scottish public library homepages; evidence of inconsistency of terminology and organisation schemes was found, with navigation not always straightforward due to a high number of loosely structured options being available from the majority of sites sampled. Initial findings are discussed including planned second stage research.

#! In this paper we address the problem of generating an image collection visualization in which images and text can be projected together. Given a collection of images with attached text annotations, we aim to find a common representation for both information sources to model latent correlations among the collection. Using the proposed latent representation, an image collection visualization is built, in which images and text can be projected simultaneously. The resulting image visualization allows to identify the relationships between images and text terms, allowing to understand the semantic structure of the collection.

#! Collection selection is traditionally a sub-problem of metasearch, and identifies collections most likely to contain relevant documents. However, we propose to treat collection selection as an independent search task with the goal of identifying collections that are relevant as a whole; so the user may return to them to serve future (related) information needs. Using a new methodology and framework we evaluate the suitability of existing collection selection algorithms for this search task, compared with a new algorithm designed specifically for the task.

#! This research-in-progress paper presents a new approach called Link Proximity Analysis (LPA) for identifying related web pages based on link analysis. In contrast to current techniques, which ignore intra-page link analysis, the one put forth here examines the relative positioning of links to each other within websites. The approach uses the fact that a clear correlation between the proximity of links to each other and the subject-relatedness of the linked websites can be observed on nearly every web page. By statistically analyzing this relationship and measuring the amount of sentences, paragraphs, etc. between two links, related websites can be automatically, identified as a first study has proven.

#! The reasons why users tag have remained mostly elusive to quantitative investigations. In this paper, we distinguish between two types of motivation for tagging: While categorizers use tags mainly for categorizing resources for later browsing, describers use tags mainly for describing resources for later retrieval. To characterize users with regard to these different motivations, we introduce statistical measures and apply them to 7 different real-world tagging datasets. We show that while most taggers use tags for both categorizing and describing resources, different tagging systems lend themselves to different motivations for tagging. Additionally we show that the distinction between describers and categorizers can improve the performance of tag recommendation.

Experimental results show that the proposed measures are consistent with the definitions and can distinguish collections effectively according to their dynamicity and diversity properties.

#! A well-known challenge of information retrieval is how to infer a user's underlying information need when the input query consists of only a few keywords. Question Answering (QA) systems face an equally important but opposite challenge: given a verbose question, how can the system infer the relative importance of terms in order to differentiate the core information need from supporting context? We investigate three simple term-weighting schemes for such estimation within the language modeling retrieval paradigm [6]. While the three schemes described are ad hoc, they address a principled estimation problem underlying the standard word unigram model. We also show these schemes enable better estimation of a state-of-the-art class model based on term clustering [5]. Using a TREC QA dataset, we evaluate the three weighting schemes for both word and class models on the QA subtask of sentence retrieval. Our inverse sentence frequency weighting scheme achieves over 5% absolute improvement in mean-average precision for the standard word model and nearly 2% absolute improvement for the class model.

The first approach was that the project team members created draft modules (total of 9) and then those modules were reviewed by the experts in the field as well as by other members of the team. The second approach was that graduate student teams developed modules under the supervision of an instructor and the project team. Four members in each team collaborated for a single module. In total four modules were produced in this way. The last approach was that five graduate students developed a total of five modules, each module reviewed by two students. The completed modules were posted in Wikiversity.org for wider distribution and collaborative improvements by the community.

#! Peer-to-peer networks have been identified as promising architectural concept for developing search scenarios across digital library collections. Digital libraries typically offer sophisticated search over their local content, however, search methods involving a network of such stand-alone components are currently quite limited. We present an architecture for highly-efficient search over digital library collections based on structured P2P networks. As the standard single-term indexing strategy faces significant scalability limitations in distributed environments, we propose a novel indexing strategy–key-based indexing. The keys are term sets that appear in a restricted number of collection documents. Thus, they are discriminative with respect to the global document collection, and ensure scalable search costs. Moreover, key-based indexing computes posting list joins during indexing time, which significantly improves query performance. As search efficient solutions usually imply costly indexing procedures, we present experimental results that show acceptable indexing costs while the retrieval performance is comparable to the standard centralized solutions with TF-IDF ranking.

#! The advent of digital libraries along with the tremendous growth of digital content call for distributed and scalable approaches for managing vast data collections. Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks emerge as a promising solution to delve with these challenges. However, the lack of global content/topology knowledge in an unstructured P2P system demands unsupervised methods for content organization and necessitates efficient and high quality search mechanisms. Towards this end, Semantic Overlay Networks (SONs) have been proposed in the literature, and in this paper, an unsupervised method for decentralized and distributed generation of SONs, called DESENT, is proposed. We prove the feasibility of our approach through analytical cost models and we show through simulations that, when compared to flooding, our approach improves recall by more than 3-10 times, depending on the network topology.

Repositories need both to preserve and make accessible primary digital objects, and facilitate their use in a myriad of ways. Following the lead of other annotation projects, we argue for the development of secondary repositories where users can compose structured collections of complex digital objects. These complex digital objects point back to the primary digital objects from which they are produced (usually with URIs) and augment these pointers with user-generated annotations and metadata. This paper examines how this layered approach to user generated metadata can enable research communities to move forward into more complex questions surrounding digital archiving and preservation, addressing not only the fundamental challenges of preserving individual digital objects long term, but also the access and usability challenges faced by key stakeholders in primary digital repository collections—scholars, educators, and students. Specifically, this project will examine the role that secondary repositories can play in the preservation and access of digital historical and cultural heritage materials with particular emphasis on streaming media.

#! We present the results of a feasibility study using shared, existing, network-accessible infrastructure for repository replication. We utilize the SMTP and NNTP protocols to replicate both the metadata and the content of a digital library, using OAI-PMH to facilitate management of the archival process. We investigate how dissemination of repository contents can be piggybacked on top of existing email and Usenet traffic. Long-term persistence of the replicated repository may be achieved thanks to current policies and procedures which ensure that email messages and news posts are retrievable for evidentiary and other legal purposes for many years after the creation date. While the preservation issues of migration and emulation are not addressed with this approach, it does provide a simple method of refreshing content with unknown partners for smaller digital repositories that do not have the administrative resources for more sophisticated solutions.

#! Metadata creation is a crucial aspect of the ingest of digital materials into digital libraries. Metadata needed to document and manage digital materials are extensive and manual creation of them expensive. The Digital Curation Centre (DCC) has undertaken research to automate this process for some classes of digital material. We have segmented the problem and this paper discusses results in genre classification as a first step toward automating metadata extraction from documents. Here we propose a classification method built on looking at the documents from five directions; as an object exhibiting a specific visual format, as a linear layout of strings with characteristic grammar, as an object with stylo-metric signatures, as an object with intended meaning and purpose, and as an object linked to previously classified objects and other external sources. The results of some experiments in relation to the first two directions are described here; they are meant to be indicative of the promise underlying this multi-facetted approach.

#! The availability of the logical structure of documents in content-oriented XML retrieval can be beneficial for users of XML retrieval systems. However, research into structured document retrieval has so far not systematically examined how structure can be used to facilitate the search process of users. We investigate how users of an XML retrieval system can be supported in their search process, if at all, through summarisation. To answer this question, an interactive information retrieval system was developed and a study using human searchers was conducted. The results show that searchers actively utilise the provided summaries, and that summary usage varied at different levels of the XML document structure. The results have implications for the design of interactive XML retrieval systems.

#! Libraries, museums, and other organizations make their electronic contents available to a growing number of users on the Web. A large fraction of the information published is stored in structured or semi-structured form. However, most users have no specific knowledge of schemas or structured query languages for accessing information stored in (relational or XML) databases. Under these circumstances, the need for facilitating access to information stored in databases becomes increasingly more important. Précis queries are free-form queries that instead of simply locating and connecting values in tables, they also consider information around these values that may be related to them. Therefore, the answer to a précis query might also contain information found in other parts of the database. In this paper, we describe a précis query answering prototype system that generates personalized presentation of short factual information précis in response to keyword queries.

CiteSeer began as the first search engine for scientific literature to incorporate Autonomous Citation Indexing, and has since grown to be a well-used, open archive for computer and information science publications, currently indexing over 730,000 academic documents. However, CiteSeer currently faces significant challenges that must be overcome in order to improve the quality of the service and guarantee that CiteSeer will continue to be a valuable, up-to-date resource well into the foreseeable future. This paper describes a new architectural framework for CiteSeer system deployment, named CiteSeer Plus. The new framework supports distributed indexing and storage for load balancing and fault-tolerance as well as modular service deployment to increase system flexibility and reduce maintenance costs. In order to facilitate novel approaches to information extraction, a blackboard framework is built into the architecture.

Digital Object Prototypes (DOPs) provide the DL designer with the ability to model diverse types of digital objects in a uniform manner while offering digital object type conformance; objects conform to the designer’s type definitions automatically. In this paper, we outline how DOPs effectively capture and express digital object typing information and finally assist in the development of unified web-based DL services such as adaptive cataloguing, batch digital object ingestion and automatic digital content conversions. In contrast, conventional DL services require custom implementations for each different type of material.

Our approach to simplify the tasks of constructing and customizing component-based digital libraries is based on an assistant tool: a setup wizard that segments those tasks into well-defined steps and drives the user along these steps. For generality purposes, the architecture of the wizard is based on the 5S framework and different wizard versions can be specialized according to the pool of components being configured. This paper describes the design and implementation of this wizard, as well as usability experiments designed to evaluate it.

The research value of important government documents to historians of medicine and law is enhanced by a digital library of such a collection being designed at the U.S. National Library of Medicine. This paper presents work toward the design of a system for preservation and access of this material, focusing mainly on the automated extraction of descriptive metadata needed for future access. Since manual entry of these metadata for thousands of documents is unaffordable, automation is required. Successful metadata extraction relies on accurate classification of key textlines in the document. Methods are described for the optimal scanning alternatives leading to high OCR conversion performance, and a combination of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for the classification of textlines and metadata extraction. Experimental results from our initial research toward an optimal textline classifier and metadata extractor are given.

#! Digital libraries focused on developing humanities resources for both scholarly and popular audiences face the challenge of bringing together digital resources built by scholars from different disciplines and subsequently integrating and presenting them. This challenge becomes more acute as libraries grow, both in terms of size and organizational complexity, making the traditional humanities practice of intensive, manual annotation and markup infeasible. In this paper we describe an approach we have taken in adding a music collection to the Cervantes Project. We use metadata and the organization of the various documents in the collection to facilitate automatic integration of new documents—establishing connection from existing resources to new documents as well as from the new documents to existing material.

#! As data become scientific capital, digital libraries of data become more valuable. To build good tools and services, it is necessary to understand scientists’ data practices. We report on an exploratory study of habitat ecologists and other participants in the Center for Embedded Networked Sensing. These scientists are more willing to share data already published than data that they plan to publish, and are more willing to share data from instruments than hand-collected data. Policy issues include responsibility to provide clean and reliable data, concerns for liability and misappropriation of data, ways to handle sensitive data about human subjects arising from technical studies, control of data, and rights of authorship. We address the implications of these findings for tools and architecture in support of digital data libraries.

#! Most digital library projects reported in the literature build resources for dense, bounded user groups, such as students or research groups in tertiary education. Having such highly interrelated and well defined user groups allows for digital library developers to use existing design methods to gather and implement requirements from those groups. This paper, however, looks at situations where digital library resources are aimed at much more sparse, ill defined networks of users. We report on a project which explicitly set out to ‘broaden access’ to tertiary education library resources to users not in higher education. In particular we discuss the problem of gathering á priori user requirements when by definition, we did not know who the users would be, we look at how disintermediation plays an even stronger negative role for sparse groups, and how we designed a system to replicate an intermediation role.

It also helps in determining when and how quality issues can be measured and how potential problems with quality can be prevented.

#! Digital file-based libraries for the audio-visual material of television broadcasters and production houses are becoming desirable. These libraries not only address the problem of loss of content due to tape deterioration, but also improve disclosure of the content. However, switching to a digital file-based library involves many new concerns and problems for content providers. This paper will discuss one of them, namely the metadata. Metadata is additional information that is required in order to be able to search, retrieve, and play out the stored content. Different standards for metadata are currently available, each having its own field of application and characteristics. In this paper, we introduce an objective framework that one can use in order to select the appropriate metadata standard for its particular type of application. This framework is applied to four well-known metadata standards, namely Dublin Core, MPEG-7, P/Meta, and SMEF.

#! Evaluation of digital libraries assesses their effectiveness, quality and overall impact. To facilitate the comparison of different evaluations and to support the re-use of evaluation data, we are proposing a new logging schema. This schema will allow for logging and sharing of a wide array of data about users, systems and their interactions. We discuss the multi-level logging framework presented in [19] and describe how the community can add to and gain from using the framework. The main focus of this paper is the logging of events within digital libraries on a generalised, conceptual level, as well as the services based on it. These services will allow diverse digital libraries to store their log data in a common repository using a common format. In addition they provide means for analysis and comparison of search history data.

#! Annotation-based discussions are an important concept for today’s digital libraries and those of the future, containing additional information to and about the content managed in the digital library. To gain access to this valuable information, discussion search is concerned with retrieving relevant annotations and comments w.r.t. a given query, making it an important means to satisfy users’ information needs. Discussion search methods can make use of a variety of context information given by the structure of discussion threads. In this paper, we present and evaluate discussion search approaches which exploit quotations in different roles as highlight and context quotations, applying two different strategies, knowledge and relevance augmentation. Evaluation shows the suitability of these augmentation strategies for the task at hand; especially knowledge augmentation using both highlight and context quotations boosts retrieval effectiveness w.r.t. the given baseline.

#! As people become more and more involved with digital information, they grow proportionally involved in situated practices of collecting. They put together large sets of information elements. However, their attention to those information elements is limited. They use whatever means are at hand in order to form representations of their collections. They need to keep track of the elements in these collections, so they can use them later. We conducted a study with 20 college students. A major concern for the students during collection building was collection management and utilization, particularly as the size and number of their collections grows. They experienced breakdowns in these processes, yet continued to engage in collecting. They developed strategies such as informal metadata schemas and hierarchical organization to try to cope with their problems. We consider the practices observed, and their implications for the development of tools to support digital collection building and utilization. Collection representations that support cognition, collaboration, and semantic schemas are prescribed.

This paper enhances objective relevance and tackles its limitations by conducting a quantitative study to understand students’ perceptions of features for supporting evaluations of subjective relevance of documents. Data was analyzed by factor analysis to identify groups of features that supported students’ document evaluations during IR interaction stages and provide design guidelines for an IR interface supporting students’ document evaluations. Findings suggested an implied order of importance amongst groups of features for each interaction stage. The paper concludes by discussing groups of features, its implied order of importance, and support for information seeking activities to provide design implications for IR interfaces supporting SR.

#! Management of video data is an indispensable part of digital library. However, currently most digital library systems only provide the functionality of retrieving video data by meta-data which can not fulfill users’ requirements. This is due to the lack of appropriate video semantic model and powerful query interface. In this paper, we propose such a model named SemTTE together with its query language VSQL. The model incorporates features of temporal structure and typed events of video contents and organizes the whole video into a tree of events. It is implemented based on XML technology with schema and instance mapped to DTD and XML documents, and queries transformed to XQuery for evaluation.

#! The digital library field is recently broadening its scope of applicability and it is also continuously adapting to the frequent changes occurring in the internet society. Accordingly, digital libraries are slightly moving from a controlled environment accessible only to professionals and domain-experts, to environments accessible to casual users that want to exploit the potentialities offered by the digital library technology. These new trends require, for instance, new search paradigms to be offered, new media content to be managed, and new description extraction techniques to be used. Building digital library applications, and effectively adapting them to new emerging trends, requires to develop a platform that offers standard and powerful building blocks to support application developers. In this paper we discuss our experience of using MILOS, a multimedia content management system oriented to the construction of digital libraries, to build a demanding application dedicated to non-professional users. Specifically, we discuss the design and implementation of an on-line photo album (PhotoBook), which is a digital library application that allows people to manage their own photos, to share them with friends, and to make them publicly available and searchable. PhotoBook, uses a complex internal metadata schema (MPEG-7) and allows users to simply express complex queries (combining similarity search and fielded search), enabling them to retrieve material of interest even if metadata are imprecise or missing.

#! Digital image collection interface layouts vary in the nature and degree of contextual information they provide to their users, thus enabling or impeding specific tasks. We are exploring image presentation techniques to support image-centric cognitive tasks in the context of cardiovascular systems research and education. To investigate the effect of image layout on user performance, we conducted an experimental evaluation of three image layouts for three representative tasks in this domain. The layouts varied the spatial and temporal presentation of images, thus providing different contextual information to the test subjects. Our results indicate that the degree of contextual information provided by the image layouts affected user performance, as did their research expertise. These results will inform the design of user interfaces for performing image-focused cognitive tasks as well as the development of interfaces for training novice researchers.

#! Graph-based ranking algorithms have recently been proposed for single document summarizations and such algorithms evaluate the importance of a sentence by making use of the relationships between sentences in the document in a recursive way. In this paper, we investigate using other related or relevant documents to improve summarization of one single document based on the graph-based ranking algorithm. In addition to the within-document relationships between sentences in the specified document, the cross-document relationships between sentences in different documents are also taken into account in the proposed approach. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on DUC 2002 data with the ROUGE metric and results demonstrate that the cross-document relationships between sentences in different but related documents can significantly improve the performance of single document summarization.

#! A usual way for content protection of digital libraries is to use digital watermarks and a DRM-based access-control environment. These methods, however, have limitations. Digital watermarks embedded in digital content could be removed by malicious users via post-processing, whereas DRM-based access-control solutions could be hacked. In this paper, we introduce a content tracking mechanism that we have built for multimedia-content near-replica detection as the second line of defense. The integrated framework aims to detect unlawful copyright infringements on the Internet, and combines the strengths of static rights enforcement and dynamic illegal content tracking. The issues of accuracy and huge computation cost in copy detection have been addressed by the introduced content-based techniques. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of proposed copy detector.

#! Integrated digital access to multiple collections is a prominent issue for many Cultural Heritage institutions. The metadata describing diverse collections must be interoperable, which requires aligning the controlled vocabularies that are used to annotate objects from these collections. In this paper, we present an experiment where we match the vocabularies of two collections by applying the Knowledge Representation techniques established in recent Semantic Web research. We discuss the steps that are required for such matching, namely formalising the initial resources using Semantic Web languages, and running ontology mapping tools on the resulting representations. In addition, we present a prototype that enables the user to browse the two collections using the obtained alignment while still providing her with the original vocabulary structures.

In our three-step method, we first construct the relationship graph of the Access Points by testing for subset relationship between any two Access Points, and assigning each Access Point a weight value designating the number of the Access Points, which are subsets to it. In the second step, we apply a topological sorting algorithm on the graph, and finally in the last step, we reject the redundant subset relationships of the Access Points.

#! A machine-learning and a string-matching approach to automated subject classification of text were compared, as to their performance, advantages and downsides. The former approach was based on an SVM algorithm, while the latter comprised string-matching between a controlled vocabulary and words in the text to be classified. Data collection consisted of a subset from Compendex, classified into six different classes. It was shown that SVM on average outperforms the string-matching approach: our hypothesis that SVM yields better recall and string-matching better precision was confirmed only on one of the classes. The two approaches being complementary, we investigated different combinations of the two based on combining their vocabularies. The results have shown that the original approaches, i.e. machine-learning approach without using background knowledge from the controlled vocabulary, and string-matching approach based on controlled vocabulary, outperform approaches in which combinations of automatically and manually obtained terms were used. Reasons for these results need further investigation, including a larger data collection and combining the two using predictions.

#! There is a lack of an integrated technology that will increase effective usage of the vast and heterogeneous multi-lingual and multimedia digital content. The need is being expressed insistently by endusers, and professionals in content business. The EU-IST Framework 6 Reveal-This (R-T) project aims at developing a complete and integrated content programming technology able to capture, semantically index, categorise, multimedia and multilingual digital content, whilst providing search, summarisation and translation functionalities. In order to fulfill this, the project proposes an architectural unit called Cross-Media Indexing Component (CMIC). CMIC leverages the individual potential of each indexing information generated by the analyzers of diverse modalities such as speech, text and image. It hypothesises that a system which combines and cross analyses different high-level modal descriptions of the same audio-visual content will perform better at retrieval and filtering time. The initial prototype utilises the Multiple Evidence approach by establishing links among the modality specific descriptions in order to depict topical similarity in the semantic textual space. This paper gives an overview of the project, CMIC’s enrichment approach and its support for retrieval.

#! The move towards integrated international Digital Libraries offers the opportunity of creating comprehensive data on citation networks. These data are not only invaluable pointers to related research, but also the basis for evaluations such as impact factors, and the foundation of smart search engines. However, creating correct citation-network data remains a hard problem, and data are often incomplete and noisy. The only viable solution appear to be systems that help authors create correct, complete, and annotated bibliographies, thus enabling autonomous citation indexing to create correct and complete citation networks. In this paper, we describe a general system architecture and two concrete components for supporting authors in this task. The system takes the author from literature search through domain-model creation and bibliography construction, to the semantic markup of bibliographic metadata. The system rests on a modular and extensible architecture: VBA Macros that integrate seamlessly into the user’s familiar working environment, the use of existing databases and information-retrieval tools, and a Web Service layer that connects them.

In this paper we present our work focused on the integration of text categorization and summarization to improve information access on a specific medical domain, patient clinical records and related scientific documentation, in the framework of two different research projects: SINAMED and ISIS, developed by a consortium of two research groups from two universities, one hospital and one software development firm. SINAMED has a basic research orientation and its goal is to design new text categorization and summarization algorithms based on the utilization of lexical resources in the biomedical domain. ISIS is a R&D project with a more applied and technology-transfer orientation, focused on more direct practical aspects of the utilization in a concrete public health institution.

#! Long-term preservation is a complicate and difficult task for a digital library. The key to handle this task is the inclusion of technical metadata. These metadata should be packed together with the files for an exchange between digital archives. Archival systems should handle the data in the Data Management and use it for preservation planning. The German project kopal has defined for this purpose the Universal Object Format (UOF) and enhanced the archival system DIAS with generic functions to support flexible handling of preservation metadata.

#! Based on a modified Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the paper describes a study to understand the relationships between perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and intention to use weblogs for learning in higher education. Data was collected from sixty-eight students of a local university. The findings suggested that students were likely to accept weblog use as a course requirement if they perceived the activity to be useful for learning. The paper concludes with a discussion on design implications for educational digital libraries.

#* Why did you pick that? Visualising relevance criteria in exploratory search
#@ Ulises Cerviño Beresi;Yunhyong Kim;Dawei Song;Ian Ruthven
#t 2010
#c 15
#! In this article, we present a set of approaches in analysing data gathered during experimentation with exploratory search systems and users’ acts of judging the relevance of the information retrieved by the system. We present three tools for quantitatively analysing encoded qualitative data: relevance-criteria profile, relevance-judgement complexity and session visualisation. Relevance-criteria profiles capture the prominence of each criterion usage with respect to the search sessions of individuals or selected user groups (e.g. groups defined by the users affiliations and/or level of research experience). Relevance-judgement complexity, on the other hand, reflects the number of criteria involved in a single judgment process. Finally, session visualisation brings these results together in a sequential representation of criteria usage and relevance judgements throughout a session, potentially allowing the researcher to quickly detect emerging patterns with respect to interactions, relevance criteria usage and complexity. The use of these tools is demonstrated using results from a pilot-user study that was conducted at the Robert Gordon University in 2008. We conclude by highlighting how these tools might be used to support the improvement of end-user services in digital libraries.

#! Search engines for Digital Libraries allow users to retrieve documents according to their contents. They process documents without differentiating the manifold aspects of information. Spatial and temporal dimensions are particularly dismissed. These dimensions are, however, of great interest for users of search engines targeting either the Web or specialized Digital Libraries. Recent studies reported that nearly 20% queries convey spatial and temporal information in addition to topical information. These three dimensions were referred to as parts of “geographic information.” In the literature, search engines handling those dimensions are called “Geographic Information Retrieval (GIR) systems.” Although several initiatives for evaluating GIR systems were undertaken, none was concerned with evaluating these three dimensions altogether. In this article, we address this issue by designing an evaluation framework, usefulness of which is highlighted through a case study involving a test collection and a GIR system. This framework allowed the comparison of our GIR system to state-of-the-art topical approaches. We also performed experiments for measuring performance improvement stemming from each dimension or their combination. We show that combining the three dimensions yields improvement in effectiveness (+73.9%) over a common topical baseline. Moreover, rather than conveying redundancy, the three dimensions complement each other.

#* Evaluation of visual video summaries: user-supplied constructs and descriptions
#@ Stina Westman
#t 2010
#c 15
#! Evaluation of video summarization approaches requires more information on the user-perceived qualities of different types of summaries. Also, evaluation measures need to be further developed in a user-led manner. This article reports on a user-centered evaluation of visual video summaries. Four types of summaries (fastforward, user-controlled fastforward, scene clips, and storyboard) were evaluated with a set of existing performance and satisfaction measures. A repertory grid elicitation was conducted with our participants gathering evaluation constructs related to both video summary content and controls. Results showed a lack of correlation between performance and satisfaction measures. User-supplied evaluation constructs were shown to span both the performance and satisfaction dimensions of the video summary evaluation space. Most constructs achieved moderate to good inter-rater agreement in a consequent survey. Free descriptions of videos and respective summaries showed that while users are able to interpret object- and event-related information from short summaries, thematic inference lacked, leading to worse descriptions than for the full videos.

#! Digital Library support for textual and certain types of non-textual documents has significantly advanced over the last years. While Digital Library support implies many aspects along the whole library workflow model, interactive and visual retrieval allowing effective query formulation and result presentation are important functions. Recently, new kinds of non-textual documents which merit Digital Library support, but yet cannot be fully accommodated by existing Digital Library technology, have come into focus. Scientific data, as produced for example, by scientific experimentation, simulation or observation, is such a document type. In this article we report on a concept and first implementation of Digital Library functionality for supporting visual retrieval and exploration in a specific important class of scientific primary data, namely, time-oriented research data. The approach is developed in an interdisciplinary effort by experts from the library, natural sciences, and visual analytics communities. In addition to presenting the concept and to discussing relevant challenges, we present results from a first implementation of our approach as applied on a real-world scientific primary data set. We also report from initial user feedback obtained during discussions with domain experts from the earth observation sciences, indicating the usefulness of our approach.

#* DiCoMo: the digitization cost model
#@ Alejandro Bia;Rafael Muñoz;Jaime Gómez
#t 2010
#c 15
#! The estimate of digitization costs is a very difficult task. It is difficult to obtain accurate values because of the great quantity of unknown factors. However, digitization projects need to have a precise idea of the economic costs and the times involved in the development of their contents. The common practice when we start digitizing a new collection is to set a schedule, and a firm commitment to fulfil it (both in terms of cost and deadlines), even before the actual digitization work starts. As it happens with software development projects, incorrect estimates produce delays and cause costs overdrafts. Based on methods used in Software Engineering for software development cost prediction like COCOMO and Function Points, and using historical data gathered during 5 years at the MCDL project, during the digitization of more than 12000 books, we have developed a method for time-and-cost estimates named DiCoMo (Digitization Cost Model) for digital content production in general. This method can be adapted to different production processes, like the production of digital XML or HTML texts using scanning and OCR, and undergoing human proofreading and error correction, or for the production of digital facsimiles (scanning without OCR). The accuracy of the estimates improve with time, since the algorithms can be optimized by making adjustments based on historical data gathered from previous tasks. Finally, we consider the problem of parallelizing tasks, i.e. dividing the work among a number of encoders that will work in parallel.

#* A hybrid system for German encyclopedia alignment
#@ Roman Kern;Christin Seifert;Michael Granitzer
#t 2010
#c 15
#! Collaboratively created on-line encyclopedias have become increasingly popular. Especially in terms of completeness they have begun to surpass their printed counterparts. Two German publishers of traditional encyclopedias have reacted to this challenge and started an initiative to merge their corpora to create a single, more complete encyclopedia. The crucial step in this merging process is the alignment of articles. We have developed a two-step hybrid system to provide high-accurate alignments with low manual effort. First, we apply an information retrieval based, automatic alignment algorithm. Second, the articles with a low confidence score are revised using a manual alignment scheme carefully designed for quality assurance. Our evaluation shows that a combination of weighting and ranking techniques utilizing different facets of the encyclopedia articles allow to effectively reduce the number of necessary manual alignments. Further, the setup of the manual alignment turned out to be robust against inter-indexer inconsistencies. As a result, the developed system empowered us to align four encyclopedias with high accuracy and low effort.

#! Requirements gathering and conceptual modeling are essential for the customization of digital libraries (DLs), to help attend the needs of target communities. In this paper, we show how to apply the 5S (Streams, Structures, Spaces, Scenarios, and Societies) formal framework to support both tasks. The intuitive nature of the framework allows for easy and systematic requirements analysis, while its formal nature ensures the precision and correctness required for semi-automatic DL generation. Further, we show how 5S can help us define a domain-specific DL metamodel in the field of archaeology. Finally, an archaeological DL case study (from the ETANA project) yields informal and formal descriptions of two DL models (instances of the metamodel).

Our work aims to resolve the issue that digital objects typing information can be currently utilized only by humans as a guide and not by programs as a digital object type conformance mechanism. Drawing on the notions of the Object Oriented Model, we propose a “type checking” mechanism that automates the conformance of digital objects to their type definitions, named digital object prototypes. We pinpoint the practical benefits gained by our approach in the development of the University of Athens Digital Library, in terms of code reuse and configuration capabilities.

The groups are described by words found on the webpages using term selection techniques and domain knowledge. We compare different term selection techniques, present a simple demonstration, and discuss our findings.

The scientific research on accessing and retrieval of music documents is becoming increasingly active, including the analysis of suitable features for content description or the development of algorithms to match relevant documents with queries. One of the challenges in this area is the possibility to extend textual retrieval techniques to music language. Music lacks of explicit separators between its lexical units, thus they have to be automatically extracted. This paper presents an overview of different approaches to melody segmentation aimed at extracting music lexical units. A comparison of different approaches is presented, showing their impact on indexes size and on retrieval effectiveness.

#! This paper reports the results of a user-centered experiment which examined the effect of parallel multi-database searching using automated collection fusion strategies on information seeking performance. Three conditions were tested in the experiment. Subjects in the first condition performed search tasks in a WWW-based distributed hypermedia digital library which did not support parallel, concurrent searching of multiple collections, and did not offer any automated mechanism for source selection. Subjects in the second and the third conditions performed parallel multi-database search tasks in the same library with the support of two automated collection fusion strategies (uniform and link-based), each solving the collection fusion problem using a different approach. The results show that information-seeking performance tends to be positively affected when the eclectic link-based method was used. On the other hand, the uniform collection fusion method which treats all the sub-collections in the same manner, does not present any benefit in comparison to information seeking environments in which users must manually select sources and parallel multi-database searching is not provided.

Metadata for multimedia documents, as for instance MPEG-7, require approximate match search functionalities to be supported in addition to exact match search. As an example, consider image search performed by using MPEG-7 visual descriptors. It does not make sense to search for images that are exactly equal to a query image. Rather, images similar to a query image are more likely to be searched. We present the architecture of an XML search engine where special techniques are used to integrate approximate and exact match search functionalities.

#! MedioVis is a visual information seeking system which was designed especially for library data. The objective target was to create a system which simplifies and optimizes the user's information seeking process and thus further motivates the user to browse in the library stock. To enhance the motivation special attention was given to consider joy of use aspects during the design of the user interface. The primary user interface design is based on multiple coordinated views to offer a great variety of exploration possibilities in a direct-manipulative manner. To accomplish a self-explanatory usability of the system for non-expert users, the development was accompanied by continuous user tests with casual and regular library users. At the end of the development process a comprehensive summative evaluation was conducted, comparing efficiency and joy of use of the existing web-based catalogue system KOALA of the library of the University of Konstanz with the MedioVis system. The results of this comparative evaluation show a significant improvement of the efficiency of the information seeking process with the help of MedioVis. The users also rated MedioVis significantly better in all dimensions of its hedonic quality and appeal compared with KOALA.

Most personalization systems employ explicitly provided user preferences rather than implicit rating data obtained automatically by collecting users' interactions. In this paper, we show that in complex information systems such as digital libraries, implicit rating data can help to characterize users' research and learning interests, and can be used to cluster users into meaningful groups. Thus, in our personalized recommender system based on collaborative filtering, we employ a user tracking system and a user modeling technique to capture and store users' implicit ratings. Also, we describe the effects (on community finding) of using four different types of implicit rating data.

This extensive browsing facility addresses a significant flaw in digital library and file management software, both of which typically provide less support for browsing than for searching, and support relatively inflexible browsing methods. Three separate usability studies of a prototype—an expert evaluation, a learnability evaluation, and a diary study—were conducted to suggest design refinements, which were then incorporated into the final system.

#! This paper investigates the information seeking of humanities academics and scholars using digital libraries. It furthers existing work by updating our knowledge of the information seeking techniques used by humanities scholars, where the current work predates the wide availability of the Internet. We also report some of the patterns observed in query and term usage by humanities scholars, and relate this to the patterns they report in their own information seeking and the problems that they encounter. This insight is used to reveal the current gap between the skills of information seekers and the technologies that they use. Searches for ‘discipline terms' prove to be particularly problematic.

#! User interfaces for digital library systems must support a wide range of user activities. They include search, browsing, and curation, but perhaps the most important is actual reading of the items in the library. Support for reading, however, is usually relegated to applications which are only loosely integrated with the digital library system. One reason for this is the absence of toolkit widget support for the activity of reading. Most user interface toolkits instead provide support for either text editing or text presentation, making it difficult to write applications which support reading well. In this paper we describe the origins, design, and implementation of a new Java Swing toolkit widget called ReadUp, which provides support for reading page images in a digital library application, and discuss briefly how it is being used.

#! Last year at the ECDL 2004 conference, we reported some initial progress and experiences developing DSpace as an open source community-driven project [8], particularly as seen from an institutional manager's viewpoint. We also described some challenges and issues. This paper describes the progress in addressing some of those issues, and developments in the DSpace open source community. We go into detail about the processes and infrastructure we have developed around the DSpace code base, in the hope that this will be useful to other projects and organisations exploring the possibilities of becoming involved in or transitioning to open source development of digital library software. Some new challenges the DSpace community faces, particularly in the area of addressing required system architecture changes, are introduced. We also describe some exciting new possibilities that open source development brings to our community.

#* File-Based storage of digital objects and constituent datastreams: XMLtapes and internet archive ARC files

#! This paper introduces the write-once/read-many XMLtape/ARC storage approach for Digital Objects and their constituent datastreams. The approach combines two interconnected file-based storage mechanisms that are made accessible in a protocol-based manner. First, XML-based representations of multiple Digital Objects are concatenated into a single file named an XMLtape. An XMLtape is a valid XML file; its format definition is independent of the choice of the XML-based complex object format by which Digital Objects are represented. The creation of indexes for both the identifier and the creation datetime of the XML-based representation of the Digital Objects facilitates OAI-PMH-based access to Digital Objects stored in an XMLtape. Second, ARC files, as introduced by the Internet Archive, are used to contain the constituent datastreams of the Digital Objects in a concatenated manner. An index for the identifier of the datastream facilitates OpenURL-based access to an ARC file. The interconnection between XMLtapes and ARC files is provided by conveying the identifiers of ARC files associated with an XMLtape as administrative information in the XMLtape, and by including OpenURL references to constituent datastreams of a Digital Object in the XML-based representation of that Digital Object.

#! The Multivalent Document Model offers a practical, proven, no-compromises architecture for preserving digital documents of potentially any data format. We have implemented from scratch such complex and currently important formats as PDF and HTML, as well as older formats including scanned paper, UNIX manual pages, TeX DVI, and Apple II AppleWorks word processing. The architecture, stable since its definition in 1997, extends easily to additional document formats, defines a cross-format document tree data structure that fully captures semantics and layout, supports full expression of a format's often idiosyncratic concepts and behavior, enables sharing of functionality across formats thus reducing implementation effort, can introduce new functionality such as hyperlinks and annotation to older formats that cannot express them, and provides a single interface (API) across all formats. Multivalent contrasts sharply with emulation and conversion, and advances Lorie's Universal Virtual Computer with high-level architecture and extensive implementation.

#! The results of an ongoing interview study with custodians of historic photograph collections are reported. In particular the success or otherwise of recent digitisation projects is addressed, as well as the extent to which these projects have affected the long term management of the collections. We examine the effects of digitisation on the primary sources, their digitised surrogates and the relationship between the two in terms of selection, authenticity and representation. In most cases we have observed that the emphasis placed by the funding bodies on ‘accessibility' of tangible numbers of resources is detrimental to these three other issues. However, we report in detail on one case study of a local history library where its digitisation work is embedded in core library activity and seen as successful and positive. We conclude by suggesting that their deliberate eschewing of short term project funding is a determining factor in their success.

#! The OAI protocol facilitates the aggregation of large numbers of heterogeneous metadata records. In order to make harvested records useable in the context of an OAI service provider, the records typically must be filtered, analyzed and transformed. The CIC metadata portal harvests 450,000 records from 18 repositories at 9 U.S. Midwestern universities. The process implemented for transforming metadata records for this project supports multiple workflows and end-user interfaces. The design of the metadata transformation process required trade-offs between aggregation homogeneity and utility for purpose and pragmatic constraints such as feasibility, human resources, and processing time.

#! The Alexandria Digital Library (ADL) project has been working on automating the processes of building ADL collections and gathering the collection statistics on which ADL's discovery system is based. As part of this effort, we have created a language and supporting programmatic framework for expressing mappings from XML metadata schemas to the required ADL metadata views. This language, based on the Python scripting language, is largely declarative in nature, corresponding to the fact that mappings can be largely—though not entirely—specified by crosswalk-type specifications. At the same time, the language allows mappings to be specified procedurally, which we argue is necessary to deal effectively with the realities of poor quality, highly variable, and incomplete metadata. An additional key feature of the language is the ability to derive new mappings from existing mappings, thereby making it easy to adapt generic mappings to the idiosyncrasies of particular metadata providers. We evaluate this language on three metadata standards (ADN, FGDC, and MARC) and three corresponding collections of metadata. We also note limitations, future research directions, and generalizations of this work.

#! The access and reproduction policies of the digital collections of ten leading university digital libraries worldwide are classified according to factors such as the creation type of the material, acquisition method, copyright ownership etc. The relationship of these factors is analyzed, showing how acquisition methods and copyright ownership affect the access and reproduction policies of digital collections. We conclude with rules about which factors lead to specific policies. For example, when the library has the copyright of the material, the reproduction for private use is usually provided free with a credit to the source or otherwise mostly under fair use provisions, but the commercial reproduction needs written permission and fees are charged. The extracted rules, which show the common practice on access and reproduction policies, constitute the policy model. Finally, conventional policies are mapped onto digital policies.

The data collection that was used comprised 1000 Web pages in engineering, to which Engineering Information classes had been manually assigned. The significance indicators were derived using several different methods: (total and partial) precision and recall, semantic distance and multiple regression. It was shown that for best results all the elements have to be included in the classification process. The exact way of combining the significance indicators turned out not to be overly important: using the F1 measure, the best combination of significance indicators yielded no more than 3% higher performance results than the baseline.

#! Peer-to-peer architectures are a potentially powerful paradigm for retrieving documents over networks of digital libraries avoiding single points of failure by massive federation of (independent) information sources. Today sharing files over P2P infrastructures is already immensely successful, but restricted to simple metadata matching. But when it comes to the retrieval of complex documents, capabilities as provided by digital libraries are needed. Digital libraries have to cope with compound documents. Though some document parts (like embedded images) can efficiently be retrieved using metadata matching, the text-based information needs different methods like full text search. However, for effective querying of texts, also information like inverted document frequencies are essential. But due to the distributed characteristics of P2P networks such 'collection-wide' information poses severe problems, e.g. that central updates whenever changes in any document collection occur use up valuable bandwidth. We will present a novel indexing technique that allows to query using collection-wide information with respect to different classifications and show the effectiveness of our scheme for practical applications. We will in detail discuss our findings and present simulations for the scheme's efficiency and scalability.

#! We propose a method for detecting survey articles in a multilingual database. Generally, a survey article cites many important papers in a research domain. Using this feature, it is possible to detect survey articles. We applied HITS, which was devised to retrieve Web pages using the notions of authority and hub. We can consider that important papers and survey articles correspond to authorities and hubs, respectively. It is therefore possible to detect survey articles, by applying HITS to databases and by selecting papers with outstanding hub scores. However, HITS does not take into account the contents of each paper, so the algorithm may detect a paper citing many principal papers in mistake for survey articles. We therefore improve HITS by analysing the contents of each paper. We conducted an experiment and found that HITS was useful for the detection of survey articles, and that our method could improve HITS.

The number of vertical portals has rapidly increased over the last years, making the importance of a topic-driven (focused) crawler evident. In this paper, we develop a latent semantic indexing classifier that combines link analysis with text content in order to retrieve and index domain specific web documents. We compare its efficiency with other well-known web information retrieval techniques. Our implementation presents a different approach to focused crawling and aims to overcome the size limitations of the initial training data while maintaining a high recall/precision ratio.

#! Daffodil is a front-end to federated, heterogeneous digital libraries targeting at strategic support of users during the information seeking process. This is done by offering a variety of functions for searching, exploring and managing digital library objects. However, the distributed search increases response time and the conceptual model of the underlying search processes is inherently weaker. This makes query formulation harder and the resulting waiting times can be frustrating. In this paper, we investigate the concept of proactive support during the user's query formulation. For improving user efficiency and satisfaction, we implemented annotations, proactive support and error markers on the query form itself. These functions decrease the probability for syntactical or semantical errors in queries. Furthermore, the user is able to make better tactical decisions and feels more confident that the system handles the query properly. Evaluations with 30 subjects showed that user satisfaction is improved, whereas no conclusive results were received for efficiency.

#! The wide adoption of the Z39.50 protocol from the Libraries exposes their abilities to participate in a distributed environment. In spite of the protocol specification of a unified global access mechanism, query failures and/or inconsistent answers are the pending issues when searching many sources due to the variant or poor implementations. The elimination of these issues heavily depends on the ability of the client to make decisions prior to initiating search requests, utilizing the knowledge of the supported search capabilities of each source. To effectively reformulate such requests, we propose a Datalog based description for capturing the knowledge about the supported search capabilities of a Z39.50 source. We assume that the accessible sources can answer some but possibly not all queries over their data, and we describe a model for their supported search capabilities using a set of parameterized queries, according to the Relational Query Description Language (RQDL) specification.

#! This paper examines the difference and similarities between the two on-line computer science citation databases DBLP and CiteSeer. The database entries in DBLP are inserted manually while the CiteSeer entries are obtained autonomously via a crawl of the Web and automatic processing of user submissions. CiteSeer's autonomous citation database can be considered a form of self-selected on-line survey. It is important to understand the limitations of such databases, particularly when citation information is used to assess the performance of authors, institutions and funding bodies. We show that the CiteSeer database contains considerably fewer single author papers. This bias can be modeled by an exponential process with intuitive explanation. The model permits us to predict that the DBLP database covers approximately 24% of the entire literature of Computer Science. CiteSeer is also biased against low-cited papers. Despite their difference, both databases exhibit similar and significantly different citation distributions compared with previous analysis of the Physics community. In both databases, we also observe that the number of authors per paper has been increasing over time.

PBDC compresses the text collection to 30–32% of its original size, permits maintaining the text compressed all the time, and offers efficient on-line information retrieval services. The novelty of PBDC is that it supports continuous growing of the compressed text collection, by automatically adapting the vocabulary both to new words and to changes in the word frequency distribution, without degrading the compression ratio. Text compressed with PBDC can be searched directly without decompression, using fast Boyer-Moore algorithms. It is also possible to decompress arbitrary portions of the collection. Alternative compression methods oriented to information retrieval focus on static collections and thus are less well suited to digital libraries.

As Digital Libraries move towards more usercentric, pro-active, collaborative functionality and application diversity, they should be among the first to take advantage of such environments. The long-term vision of the field for creating Dynamic Universal Knowledge Environments calls for intensive computation and processing of very large amounts of information, hence, the needs for the appropriate distributed architecture are pressing.

The results of this new orientation are ad-hoc solutions for different components and services of DLMS: the data repository, the data manager, the search and retrieval components, etc. We are particularly interested in the evaluation aspects that range from measuring and quantifying the performances of the information access and extraction components of a DLMS to designing and developing an architecture for a system capable of supporting this kind of evaluation in the context of DLMS[3,4].

#! Recent advances in digital library technologies are making it possible to build federated discovery services which aggregate metadata from different digital libraries (data providers) and provide a unified search interface to users. In this work we develop a framework that enables data providers to control access to their content in the federation. We have built and tested such a framework based on XACML and Shibboleth.

#! Skill and knowledge of master workmen and artists are important information for digital libraries. Usually disciples acquire the skill and knowledge by conversation with masters and watching the master's works. Therefor they can be conveyed to limited number of disciples and they are sometimes lost when masters and artists pass away. A digital library for skill and knowledge plays an important role to preserve and convey them to large number of people. Since skill and knowledge inherent in masters and artists, first we need to externalize and represent them in an appropriate form. Interview to masters and artists are effective way to record their skill and knowledge. It can record various kinds of information such as emotional behavior, procedure of creative activity as well as verbal information in conversation. Furthermore interview enables us to obtain the information from masters and artists without heavy mental load. This characteristics is effective not only for gathering information of the skill and knowledge of masters and artists but also for externalizing knowledge of human beings in many fields.

#! Search performance can be greatly improved by describing data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to create new metadata for digital libraries. In this paper, a methodology is presented to use a specific domain knowledge to improve user request. This domain knowledge is based on concepts, extracted from the document itself, used as “semantic metadata tags” in order to annotate XML documents. We present the process followed to define and to add new XML semantic metadata into the digital library of scientific theses. Using these new metadata, an ontology is also built to complete the annotation process. Effective retrieval information is obtained by using an intelligent system based on our XML semantic metadata and a domain ontology.

Private electronic archives, maintained by companies, governments and other bodies grow at similar rates. While search techniques have scaled to manage these vast collections, most interfaces between search engines and searchers, usually based on a ranked list, are increasingly insufficient. This paper explains how Information Foraging Theory was applied to create visualisations of query resultsets which, when embedded in an application that contained tools to manipulate the visualisation, helped alleviate the deficiencies of the ranked list.

#! The estimate of web-content production costs is a very difficult task. It is difficult to make exact predictions due to the great quantity of unknown factors. However, digitization projects need to have a precise idea of the economic costs and times involved in the development of their contents. As it happens with software development projects, incorrect estimates give way to delays and costs overdrafts. Based on methods used in Software Engineering for software development cost prediction like COCOMO [1]) and Function Points [2], and using historical data gathered during five years of work at the Miguel de Cervantes Digital Library, where more than 12.000 books were digitized, we have refined an equation for digitization cost estimates named DiCoMo (Digitization Cost Model). This method can be adapted to different production processes, like the production of digital XML or HTML texts using scanning plus OCR and human proofreading, or the production of digital facsimiles (scanning images without OCR). The estimates done a priori are improved as the project evolves by means of adjustments based on real data obtained from previous stages of the production process. Each estimate is a refinement obtained as a result of the work done so far.

Observations have recently been made as to why researchers might be reluctant to contribute to central repositories [1]. It has been suggested that it might be useful to provide researchers with tools to easily create and share Personal Digital Repositories (PDR) designed to organize and facilitate their research and learning agendas. The collection in the PDR is built and managed by the scholar based on individual needs.

The Open Archives Initiative (OAI) is making feasible to build high level services such as a federated search service that harvests metadata from different data providers using the OAI protocol for metadata harvesting (OAI-PMH) and provides a unified search interface. There are numerous challenges to build and maintain a federation service, and one of them is managing duplicates. Detecting exact duplicates where two records have identical set of metadata fields is straight-forward. The problem arises when two or more records differ slightly due to data entry errors, for example. Many duplicate detection algorithms exist, but are computationally intensive for large federated digital library. In this paper, we propose an efficient duplication detection algorithm for a large federated digital library like Arc.

#! Using keyword search to find relevant objects in digital libraries often results in way too large result sets. Based on the metadata associated with such objects, the faceted search paradigm allows users to structure and filter the result set, for example, using a publication type facet to show only books or videos. These facets usually focus on clear-cut characteristics of digital items, however it is very difficult to also organize the actual semantic content information into such a facet. The Semantic GrowBag approach, presented in this paper, uses the keywords provided by many authors of digital objects to automatically create light-weight topic categorization systems as a basis for a meaningful and dynamically adaptable topic facet. Using such emergent semantics enables an alternative way to filter large result sets according to the objects' content without the need to manually classify all objects with respect to a pre-specified vocabulary. We present the details of our algorithm using the DBLP collection of computer science documents and show some experimental evidence about the quality of the achieved results.

We present a principled framework for integrating structured metadata and unstructured resource content in a seamless manner which can then be flexibly queried using structured queries expressed in natural language. The novelty of the approach lies in the combination of different semantic technologies providing a clear benefit for the application scenario considered. The resulting system is implemented as part of the digital library of British Telecommunications (BT). The original contribution of our paper lies in the architecture we present allowing for the nonstraightforward integration of the different components we consider.

Ranking publications of Online Digital Libraries (ODLs) is useful for (i) providing comparative assessment of publications and (ii) listing relevant ODL search results first in search outputs, enabling users to aggregate pertinent results quickly and easily. Studies show that effective citation-based scoring functions, namely, PageRank, HITS and Citation Count, are highly skewed, and have accuracy problems, possibly due to topic diffusion. In this paper, based on the notion of research pyramids, we propose an a priori technique to assign more effective publication scores. Using the ACM SIGMOD Anthology ODL as a testbed, we show that our approach provides more accurate and less skewed publication scores.

In digital libraries such as DLESE, NSDL and G-Portal, metadata records are created for some good quality Web content objects so as to make them more accessible. These Web objects are dynamic making it necessary to update their metadata records. As Web metadata maintenance involves manual efforts, we propose to reduce the efforts by introducing the Key element-Context (KeC) model tomonitor only those changes made on Web page content regions that concern metadata attributes while ignoring other changes. We also develop evaluation metrics to measure the number of alerts and the amount of efforts in updating Web metadata records. KeC model has been experimented on metadata records defined for Wikipedia articles, and its performance with different settings is reported. The model is implemented in G-Portal as a metadata maintenance module.

In particular, we introduce an automated method to time align given lyrics to an audio recording of the underlying song using a combination of synchronization algorithms. Furthermore, we describe a lyrics search engine and show how the lyrics-audio alignments can be used to directly navigate from the list of query results to the corresponding matching positions within the audio recordings.

#! The availability of large music repositories poses challenging research problems, which are also related to the identification of different performances of music scores. This paper presents a methodology for music identification based on hidden Markov models. In particular, a statistical model of the possible performances of a given score is built from the recording of a single performance. To this end, the audio recording undergoes a segmentation process, followed by the extraction of the most relevant features of each segment. The model is built associating a state for each segment and by modeling its emissions according to the computed features. The approach has been tested with a collection of orchestral music, showing good results in the identification and tagging of acoustic performances.

#! We present MinervaDL, a digital library architecture that supports approximate information retrieval and filtering functionality under a single unifying framework. The architecture of MinervaDL is based on the peer-to-peer search engine Minerva, and is able to handle huge amounts of data provided by digital libraries in a distributed and self-organizing way. The two-tier architecture and the use of the distributed hash table as the routing substrate provides an infrastructure for creating large networks of digital libraries with minimal administration costs. We discuss the main components of this architecture, present the protocols that regulate node interactions, and experimentally evaluate our approach.

In large-scale distributed retrieval, challenges of latency, heterogeneity, and dynamicity emphasise the importance of infrastructural support in reducing the development costs of state-of-the-art solutions. We present a service-based infrastructure for distributed retrieval which blends middleware facilities and a design framework to 'lift' the resource sharing approach and the computational services of a European Grid platform into the domain of e-Science applications. In this paper, we give an overview of the DILIGENT Search Framework and illustrate its exploitation in the field of Earth Science.

#! This paper describes the VIRGIL (Virtual Meeting Archival) system which was developed to provide a simple, practical, easy-to-use method for recording, indexing and archiving large scale distributed videoconferences held over Access Grid nodes. Institutional libraries are coming under increasing pressure to support the storage, access and retrieval of such mixed-media complex digital objects in their institutional repositories. Although systems have been developed to record access grid sessions, they don't provide simple mechanisms for repository ingestion, search and retrieval; and they require the installation and understanding of complex Access Grid tools to record and replay the virtual meetings. Our system has been specifically designed to enable both: the easy construction and maintenance of an archive of Access Grid sessions by managers; and easy search and retrieval of recorded sessions by users. This paper describes the underlying architecture, tools and Web interface we developed to enable the recording, storage, search, retrieval and replay of collaborative Access Grid sessions within a Fedora repository.

Object transformation for preservation purposes is currently a hit-or-miss affair, where errors in transformation may go unnoticed for years since manual quality assurance is too resource-intensive for large collections of digital objects. We propose an approach of semi-automatic quality assurance (QA), where numerous separate automatic checks of "aspects" of the objects, combined with manual inspection, provides greater assurance that objects are transformed with little or no loss of quality. We present an example of using this approach to appraise the quality of OpenOffice's import of Word documents.

#! One of the main goals of the Nautical Archaeology Digital Library (NADL) is to assist nautical archaeologists in the reconstruction of ancient ships and the study of shipbuilding techniques. Ship reconstruction is a specialized task that requires supporting materials such as reference to fragments and timbers recovered from other excavations and consultation of shipbuilding treatises. The latter are manuscripts written in a variety of languages and spanning several centuries. Due to their diverse provenance, technical content, and time of writing, shipbuilding treatises are complex written sources. In this paper we discuss a digital library approach to handle these manuscripts and their multilingual properties (often including unknown terms and concepts), and how scholars in different countries are collaborating in this endeavor. Our collection of treatises raises interesting challenges and provides a glimpse of the relationship between texts and illustrations, and their mapping to physical objects.

This Product Library is a central part of DFD's multi-mission ground segment Data and Information Management System (DIMS) currently hosting one million digital products, corresponding to 150 Terabyte of data. Its data model is regularly extended to support products of upcoming earth observation missions. The ever increasing complexity led to the development of operating interfaces which use a-priori and context knowledge, allowing efficient management of the dynamic library content. This paper presents the development and operating of context-sensitive library access tools based on meta modeling and online grammar interpretation.

#! On the Internet, a large number of documents such as news articles and online journals are delivered everyday. We often have to review major topics and topic transitions from a large time-series of documents, but it requires much time and effort to browse and analyze the target documents. We have therefore developed an information visualization system called T-Scroll (Trend/Topic-Scroll) to visualize the transition of topics extracted from those documents. The system takes periodical outputs of the underlying clustering system for a time-series of documents then visualizes the relationships between clusters as a scroll. Using its interaction facility, users can grasp the topic transitions and the details of topics for the target time period. This paper describes the idea, the functions, the implementation, and the evaluation of the T-Scroll system.

#! We propose and evaluate a query expansion mechanism that supports searching and browsing in collections of annotated documents. Based on generative language models, our feedback mechanism uses document-level annotations to bias the generation of expansion terms and to generate browsing suggestions in the form of concepts selected from a controlled vocabulary (as typically used in digital library settings). We provide a detailed formalization of our feedback mechanism and evaluate its effectiveness using the TREC 2006 Genomics track test set. As to the retrieval effectiveness, we find a 20% improvement in mean average precision over a query-likelihood baseline, whilst increasing precision at 10. When we base the parameter estimation and feedback generation of our algorithm on a large corpus, we also find an improvement over state-of-theart relevance models. The browsing suggestions are assessed along two dimensions: relevancy and specifity. We present an account of per-topic results, which helps understand for what type of queries our feedback mechanism is particularly helpful.

#! This paper is about searching literature digital libraries to find "related" publications of a given publication. Existing approaches do not take into account publication topics in the relatedness computation, allowing topic diffusion across query output publications. In this paper, we propose a new way to measure "relatedness" by incorporating "contexts" (representing topics) of publications. We utilize existing ontology terms as contexts for publications, i.e., publications are assigned to their relevant contexts, where a context characterizes one or more publication topics. We define three ways of context-based relatedness, namely, (a) relatedness between two contexts (context-to-context relatedness) by using publications that are assigned to the contexts and the context structures in the context hierarchy, (b) relatedness between a context and a paper (paper-to-context relatedness), which is used to rank the relatedness of contexts with respect to a paper, and (c) relatedness between two papers (paper-to-paper relatedness) by using both paper-to-context and context-to-context relatedness measurements. Using existing biomedical ontology terms as contexts for genomics-oriented publications, our experiments indicate that the context-based approach is accurate, and solves the topic diffusion problem by effectively classifying and ranking related papers of a given paper based on the selected contexts of the paper.

#! This paper proposes a unified extractive approach based on affinity graph to both generic and topic-focused multi-document summarizations. By using an asymmetric similarity measure, the relationships between sentences are reflected in a directed affinity graph for generic summarization. For topic-focused summarization, the topic information is incorporated into the affinity graph using a topic-sensitive affinity measure. Based on the affinity graph, the information richness of sentences is computed by the graph-ranking algorithm on differentiated intra-document links and inter-document links between sentences. Lastly, the greedy algorithm is employed to impose diversity penalty on sentences and the sentences with both high information richness and high information novelty are chosen into the summary. Experimental results on the tasks of DUC 2002-2005 demonstrate the excellent performances of the proposed approaches to both generic and topic-focused multi-document summarization tasks.

Simple clusters have been created for a collection of more than six and a half million library metadata records using a linear clustering algorithm. The created clusters are used to enrich the metadata records, and search results are presented to the user using a faceted browsing interface alongside a ranked result list. The most frequent tags in the different facets in the search result can be calculated and presented at a rate of approximately three million records per second per machine.

#! Annotations are an important part in today's digital libraries and Web information systems as an instrument for interactive knowledge creation. Annotation-based document retrieval aims at exploiting annotations as a rich source of evidence for document search. The POLAR framework supports annotation-based document search by translating POLAR programs into four-valued probabilistic datalog and applying a retrieval strategy called knowledge augmentation, where the content of a document is augmented with the content of its attached annotations. In order to evaluate this approach and POLAR's performance in document search, we set up a test collection based on a snapshot of ZDNet News, containing IT-related articles and attached discussion threads. Our evaluation shows that knowledge augmentation has the potential to increase retrieval effectiveness when applied in a moderate way.

#! The task of searching for documents is becoming more challenging as the volumes of data stored continues to increase, and retrieval systems produce longer results list. Graphical visualisations can assist users to more efficiently and effectively understand large volumes of information. This work investigates the use of multiple visualisations in a desktop search tool. These visualisations include a List View, Tree View, Map View, Bubble View, Tile View and Cloud View. A preliminary evaluation was undertaken by 94 participants to gauge its potential usefulness and to detect usability issues with its interface and graphical presentations. The evaluation results show that these visualisations made it easier and quicker for them to find relevant documents. All of the evaluators found at least one of the visualisations useful and over half of them found at least three of the visualisations to be useful. The evaluation results support the research premise that a combination of integrated visualisations will result in a more effective search tool. The next stage of work is to improve the current views in light of the evaluation findings in preparation for the scalability and longitudinal tests for a series of increasingly larger result sets of documents.

#! Digitized scientific documents should be marked up according to domain-specific XML schemas, to make maximum use of their content. Such markup allows for advanced, semantics-based access to the document collection. Many NLP applications have been developed to support automated annotation. But NLP results often are not accurate enough; and manual corrections are indispensable. We therefore have developed the GoldenGATE editor, a tool that integrates NLP applications and assistance features for manual XML editing. Plain XML editors do not feature such a tight integration: Users have to create the markup manually or move the documents back and forth between the editor and (mostly command line) NLP tools. This paper features the first empirical evaluation of how users benefit from such a tight integration when creating semantically rich digital libraries. We have conducted experiments with humans who had to perform markup tasks on a document collection from a generic domain. The results show clearly that markup editing assistance in tight combination with NLP functionality significantly reduces the user effort in annotating documents.

#* Digital libraries without databases: the Bleek and Lloyd collection
#@ Hussein Suleman
#t 2007
#c 15
#! Digital library systems are frequently defined with a focus on data collections, traditionally implemented as databases. However, when preservation and widespread access are most critical, some curators are considering how best to build digital library systems without databases. In many instances, XML-based formats are recommended because of many known advantages. This paper discusses the Bleek and Lloyd Collection, where such a solution was adopted. The Bleek and Lloyd Collection is a set of books and drawings that document the language and culture of some Bushman groups in Southern Africa, arguably one of the oldest yet most vulnerable and fragile cultures in the world. Databases were avoided because of the need for multi-OS support, longterm preservation and the use of large collections in remote locations with limited Internet access. While there are many advantages in using XML, scalability concerns are a limiting factor. This paper discusses how many of the scalability problems were overcome, resulting in a viable XML-centric solution for both greater preservation and access.

We studied 18,120 citations in the personal collections of 96 users of RefWorks citation management system to understand these in terms of their resolvability i.e. how well these citations can be resolved to a unique identifier and to their online sources. While fewer than 4% of citations to articles in Journals and Conferences included a DOI, we were able to increase this resolvability to 50% by using a citation resolver. A much greater percentage of book citations included an ISBN (53%), but using an online resolver found ISBNs for an additional 20% of the book citations. Considering all citation types, we were able to resolve approximately 47% of all citations to either an online source or a unique identifier.

In March 2006, a rating service and a review service were added to the already existing behavior-based recommender system. Logged-in users can write reviews and rate all library documents (books, journals, multimedia, etc.); reading reviews and inspecting ratings are open to the general public. A role system is implemented that supports the submission of different reviews for the same document from one user to different user groups (students, scientists, etc.). Mechanism design problems like bias and free riding are discussed, to address these problems the introduction of incentive systems is described. Usage statistics are given and the question, which recommender system supports which user needs best, is covered. Summing up, recommender systems are a way to combine the support of library user interaction with information access beyond catalog searches.

#! We introduce a model of uncertainty where documents are not uniquely identified in a reference network, and some links may be incorrect. It generalizes the probabilistic approach on databases to graphs, and defines subgraphs with a probability distribution. The answer to a relational query is a distribution of documents, and we study how to approximate the ranking of the most likely documents and quantify the quality of the approximation. The answer to a function query is a distribution of values and we consider the size of the interval of Minimum and Maximum values as a measure for the precision of the answer.

#! Current research in large-scale information management systems is focused on unsupervised methods and techniques for information processing. Such approaches support scalability in regard to present-day exponential growth in information processing needs. In this paper we focus on the problem of automated quality evaluation of a completely unsupervised metadata extraction process in the Digital Libraries domain. In particular, we investigate resulting metadata quality applying specific extraction methodology for scientific documents. We propose and discuss precise quality metrics and measure the dynamics of such quality metrics as a function of the extracted information from the repository and size of the repository.

This paper describes the DBLP WebCrawler, a meta search engine that is able to search for full text publications in PDF format for each DBLP entry on the web. Various search engines such as Google and Yahoo are used as data sources. The retrieved documents are additionally analysed and ranked according to their relevance. The proposed system differs from systems like CiteSeer in so far, that the DBLP Webcrawler builds upon metadata and tries to find relevant full-texts whereas Cite-Seer mainly starts with full-texts and extracts metadata.

#* In-browser digital library services

#! Service models for digital libraries have looked into how services may be decomposed into modules and components for greater flexiblity. These models are, however, mostly aimed at server-side applications. With the emergence of Ajax and similar techniques for processing XML documents within a Web browser, it has now become feasible for a browser to perform far more of the computational tasks traditionally encompassed in server-side DL services. Among other advantages, moving computation to the client can result in improved performance and scalability. As a new twist on service oriented computing, it is argued in this paper that digital library services can be provided partially or wholly through applications that execute client-side. Two case studies are provided to illustrate that such in-browser services are feasible and in fact more powerful and flexible than the traditional server-side service model.

#! Optical music recognition (OMR) enables librarians to digitise early music sources on a large scale. The cost of expert human labour to correct automatic recognition errors dominates the cost of such projects. To reduce the number of recognition errors in the OMR process, we present an innovative approach to adapt the system dynamically, taking advantage of the human editing work that is part of any digitisation project. The corrected data are used to perform MAP adaptation, a machine-learning technique used previously in speech recognition and optical character recognition (OCR). Our experiments show that this technique can reduce editing costs by more than half.

With advanced visualisations uncovering the contents and its structure, and advanced interaction modes as zooming, panning and area selection, the SOM becomes a feasible alternative to classical interfaces. However, there are still shortcomings in helping the user to understand the map - there are insufficient methods developed for describing the map to support the user in the analysis of the map contents. In this paper, we present recent work in assisting the user in exploring the map by automatically describing maps using advanced labelling and summarisation of map regions.

We examine and analyze the above policies in relation to specific factors, such as, the acquisition method, copyright ownership, library type (national, academic, etc.), content creation (digitized, born-digital) and content type (audio, video, etc.); how these factors affect the policies of the examined digital collections. Responses were received from a range of library sectors but by far the best responses came from academic libraries, in which we focus. We extract policy (access, reproduction) rules and alternatives according to these factors that lead to a policy decision tree on digital information management for academic libraries. The resulting decision tree is based on a policy model; the model and tree are divided into two parts: for digitized and born-digital content.

#% 567134
#! This paper describes the development of a distributed annotation system which enables collaborative document consultation and creates new access to otherwise hard to index digital documents. It takes the annotations one step further: not only the same types of annotations are available across file formats, but robust references to the documents introduce format and location independence, and enable the attachment even when the document has been modified. These features are achieved using standards of the digital library systems, and don't require modification of the original documents or impose further restrictions, thus being infrastructure independent. Integration into the Kepler workflow system allows annotating workflow results, and the automatic creation and indexing of annotations in document oriented workflows, which can be used as a flexible way to archive and index collections in the Cheshire3 search engine.

#! At present, digital scientific resources can be hardly read by visually impaired people. The systems to retrieve and download documents in digital libraries can be easily used also through speech and tactile assistive technologies. The main problems concern the digital formats employed to store documents. Therefore, visually impaired readers often find the right document, but they cannot read it. That often affects the learning process especially at university. In order to contribute to the preparation of guidelines to provide accessible digital scientific resources and to widespread best practices and best experiences achieved by university libraries and support services, the thematic network aScience was established. It is a two years project supported by the European Union eContentPlus Programme. The web portal www.ascience.eu delivers information about the thematic network activities and it will distribute sample documents of digital scientific literature accessible through speech and tactile assistive technologies.

#! The number of newly generated multimedia documents (e.g. music, e-learning material, or 3D-graphics) increases year by year. Today, the workflow in digital libraries focuses on textual documents only. Hence, considering content-based retrieval tasks, multimedia documents are not analyzed and indexed sufficiently. To facilitate content-based retrieval and browsing, it is necessary to introduce recent techniques for multimedia document processing into the workflow of nowadays digital libraries. In this short paper, we introduce the PROBADO-framework which will (a) integrate different types of content-repositories - each one specialized for a specific multimedia domain - into one seamless system, and (b) will add features available in text-based digital libraries (such as automatic annotation, full-text retrieval, or recommender services) to non-textual documents. Existing libraries will benefit from the framework since it extends existing technology for handling textual documents with features for dealing with the non-textual domain.

The platform provides a number of functions, such as digital video archiving, format transformation, streaming broadcasts, editing, geotagging, and blogging. The concept of Web2.0 is conducted in VCenter to increase user participation and improve interaction between the system and the user. For videos, VCenter adopts Flash technology because it has a multi-layer architecture and it can handle multimedia content. We can add watermarks or captions as layers to videos without changing the original video's content so that when users browse videos, the multi-layer overlaps the original video layer in real-time. VCenter serves the Union Catalog system of NDAP as a video broadcasting platform. In addition to archiving the valuable videos of NDAP, it allows the general public to archive, broadcast, and share digital videos.

#! The Digital Image Archiving System (DIAS) is an image management system, the major functions of which are preserving valuable digital images and serving as an image provider for external metadata archiving systems. To enhance the security of images, DIAS enables online adding of watermarks to an image to protect the content owner's copyright. We use the Flash format to add watermarks because it has a multi-layer architecture and it can handle multimedia content. The function allows us to set the watermark as a layer that overlaps the original image. DIAS also provides an offline DRM (Digital Rights Management) mechanism to protect downloaded images. We package an image and its authorized information in an execution file for downloading. Then, when a user executes the file, the program validates the authorized information before showing the image. Using the watermark and offline DRM improves the security of DIAS images.

In this paper we consider the semantics and pragmatics of preference queries over tables containing information objects described through a set of attributes. In particular, we address two basic issues: - how to define a preference query and its answer (semantics) - how to evaluate a preference query (pragmatics) The main contributions of this paper are (a) the proposal of an expressive language for declaring qualitative preferences, (b) a novel approach to evaluating a preference query (c) the design of a user friendly interface with preference queries. Although our main motivation originates in digital libraries, our proposal is quite general and can be used in several application contexts.

This is in conjunction with the LLDL project for developing stimulating interactive educational tasks that can be built on top of digital libraries made in Greenstone's open source software specifically to support language teaching and learning. The relevance of the proposed work includes the development of training modules and in-depth workshops for language teachers and students involved in the participatory design of stimulating educational activities that can be uploaded to create digital library collections. Digital libraries can support language teaching and learning through the use of authentic media, comprehensive searching capabilities, and automatically generated precision-targeted exercise material. They also provide social computing environments for teacher-to-student and peer-to-peer communications, along with opportunities to collaborate on group projects. What is more, teachers can build their own digital resource collections and these can be shared among online teaching communities which include annotations and reflections on how to best integrate the digital library technology into their teaching practice.
